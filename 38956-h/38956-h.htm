ready in the course of next year, will be devoted to the history
of the remaining Orders of Birds, and will also contain the
Introduction and Index, and complete the work.</p>

<p>All the personal observations recorded in these pages are
due to Mr. Hudson, while I am responsible for the arrangement,
nomenclature, and scientific portions of the work.</p>

<p>As regards its Bird-life the Neotropical Region, which, according to
the arrangement usually adopted, consists of America south of the
Isthmus of Tehuantepec together with the West
Indies<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>, may be most
conveniently divided into six Subregions. These are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The <i>Transpanamic Subregion</i>, embracing the great Central-American
Isthmus from Tehuantepec down to Panama.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Antillean Subregion</i>, containing the West-India Islands.</p>

<p>3. The <i>Colombian Subregion</i>, containing the South-American littoral
and the adjacent Andean ranges in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru,
and Bolivia.</p>

<p>4. The <i>Amazonian Subregion</i>, containing Guiana and the valleys of
the Orinoco and Amazons and their confluents.</p>

<p>5. The <i>Brazilian Subregion</i>, containing the great wooded and campos
districts of Southern Brazil and Paraguay.</p>

<p>6. The <i>Patagonian Subregion</i>, consisting of Antarctic America up to
the Brazilian wood-districts and the highlands of Bolivia on the eastern
side of the Andes, and apparently extending as far as the Gulf of
Guayaquil on the west.</p>

<p>It is, of course, impossible to draw a precise line between these six
Subregions, and any boundaries assigned to them can only be regarded
as approximative; but it is obvious that nearly, if not quite, the whole of
the Argentine Republic, the Avifauna of which we are now considering,
comes within the limits of the Patagonian Subregion. It is possible
that the birds of the Territory of Misiones and of some parts of Northern
Corrientes may be more nearly akin to those of Brazil, but we may say
generally that the Argentine Republic belongs to the Patagonian Subregion.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">-&nbsp;xviii&nbsp;-</a>As shown
in the succeeding pages, the number of species of Birds as
yet ascertained to be found within the Argentine
Republic<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> is about
430. We will now take the leading groups of the Neotropical Ornis,
one after another, and consider the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> they play in the Argentine
Avifauna, so as to get some general ideas as to its peculiarities.</p>

<p>The subjoined Table contains in the first column the number of Neotropical
species assigned to each of the 20 different Orders of Birds in
the &lsquo;Nomenclator Avium Neotropicalium.&rsquo; In the second column is
given the corresponding number of Argentine species of each order
according to the present work. The total number of Neotropical species
will be seen to be about eight times as many as those of the Argentine
Avifauna; so that where this average is exceeded in the individual orders
the particular group may be considered to be over-represented, and
where it is not reached to be under-represented in the Argentine Avifauna.
This is of course a very rough-and-ready mode of calculation,
because it assumes that every species has an equal area of distribution,
which is not ordinarily the case; but it will serve to give us some
general ideas on the subject. We will now proceed to consider the
principal groups one after another, and to point out their comparative
importance in the Argentine Avifauna.</p>

<p>The known Argentine Passeres, according to the present work, are
229 in number; those of the Neotropical Region, according to the
&lsquo;Nomenclator,&rsquo; are 1976; so that the species of Argentine Passeres,
according to the ratio which we have adopted, would be very little short
of the average numbers. If, however, we divide the Passeres up into
the three suborders of Oscines, Oligomyod&aelig;, and Tracheophon&aelig;, we
shall find that the Oligomyod&aelig; are rather in excess of the estimated
average, while the species of the two other groups are deficient. This
arises mainly from the large number of Tyrannid&aelig; belonging to the
Argentine Ornis. Not less than 63 species of this group have been
already discovered within its limits. Besides Tyrants, other prevailing
families of Passeres in the Argentine Avifauna are the Finches (Fringillid&aelig;)
and the Wood-hewers (Dendrocolaptid&aelig;), both of which have
46 representatives in the Argentine Republic. Both these families are,
however, well represented all over the Neotropical Region. But the
Tapacolas (Pteroptochid&aelig;) and the Plant-cutters (Phytotomid&aelig;) are both
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">-&nbsp;xix&nbsp;-</a>of
them families specially characteristic of the Patagonian Avifauna, and
both of them are represented in the Argentine Republic. One other
Passerine form is also worthy of special mention. The Dippers (Cinclid&aelig;)
are essentially an Arctic group diffused all over the Pal&aelig;arctic
and the Arctic Regions. It is singular, however, that this form should
reoccur at higher elevations in the Neotropical Region. A <i>Cinclus</i> is
found in the mountains of Colombia, another in the Andes of Peru, and
a third has lately been discovered in the northern sierras of the Argentine
Republic. As regards Passerine birds, therefore, which great order
makes up more than one half of the Argentine Ornis, we may say that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">-&nbsp;xx&nbsp;-</a>
Finches, Tyrants, and Wood-hewers are remarkable for their abundance,
Plant-cutters and Tapacolas for peculiarity of type, and Dippers as an
instance of the occurrence of an Arctic form in Antarctic latitudes.</p>

<p>As regards the second order, Macrochires, the Argentine Avifauna is
notably deficient on account of the comparative scarcity of Humming-birds.
Although eleven species of this remarkable group have been
met with within our limits, the great mass of the Trochilid&aelig;, which are
now known to number some 400 species, belong to the Tropics. The
Swifts are also scantily represented by a single species. The Caprimulgid&aelig;
are comparatively more abundant, but slightly below the average
in number of species.</p>

<p>The Argentine Woodpeckers enumerated in the present work are
thirteen in number, but several of those are somewhat doubtful species,
and others only occur in the extreme northern limits of the Republic. On
the whole we may say that the <i>Pici</i> are decidedly deficient in Argentina.</p>

<p>Nine families of the fourth order, Coccyges, are included in the
Neotropical Avifauna, but of these only five are represented in the
Argentine Ornis&mdash;the Motmots, Todies, Jacamars, and Barbets being
entirely wanting. The Trogons, Puff-birds, and Toucans are also
essentially Tropical forms, and have but one or two representatives on
the northern outskirts of the Republic; so that the Cuckoos and Kingfishers
are the only two families of Coccyges which play any material
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> in the Argentine Ornis.</p>

<p>Of the order of Parrots it will be seen from our Table that 142 species
are known as belonging to the Neotropical Region, and that only ten of
these have been met with within our limits. Of these ten, moreover,
several are either doubtful, or only occur on the northern outskirts of
Argentina, so that Parrots must be held to be deficient in the Argentine
Ornis. As is well known Parrots are mostly inhabitants of the Tropics,
and it is quite an exception to the rule that several of these warmth-loving
birds should extend into the cold latitudes of Patagonia and Chili.
This, however, is paralleled in the Old World by the existence of Parrots
in some of the Antarctic Islands south of New Zealand.</p>

<p>Of the Birds of Prey of the Argentine Republic, Diurnal and Nocturnal,
it is not necessary to say much; both of these orders are rather
in excess as regards the average number of species, the Accipitres especially
so. The wide open pampas offer a fine field for Kites and Buzzards
and their kind, and they are as numerous in individuals as in
species in such favoured haunts.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">-&nbsp;xxi&nbsp;-</a>In
the next order, Steganopodes, the Argentine Ornis seems to be
very deficient. Out of the five families of this group which occur in
the Neotropical Region, one only is yet known to us to be represented
in the Argentine Ornis, and that by a single species. But when the
sea-birds of the Argentine coast-land come to be better known, there
is no doubt that several additions will be made to the list.</p>

<p>The next following order, Herodiones, is of much more importance in
Argentine Ornithology, not less than 19 species of this group being
already known to exist within our limits, out of a total of 44 Neotropical
species. And amongst these we can pick out the little Variegated
Bittern (<i>Ardetta involucris</i>) and the four species of Ibises as being highly
characteristic members of the Argentine Ornis.</p>

<p>The tenth order, that of Anseres, or Waterfowl, commonly so-called,
is also largely in excess as regards the number of species. Out of a
total of 64 Anseres belonging to the Neotropical Regions, 23 are met
with in the Argentine Republic. Moreover, the greater number of
these are exclusively Antarctic species, restricted to the Patagonian
Subregion. Amongst them we may specially call attention to the
Black-necked Swan (<i>Cygnus nigricollis</i>), the Chiloe Wigeon (<i>Mareca
sibilatrix</i>), and the Rosy-billed Duck (<i>Metopiana peposaca</i>) as highly
characteristic and ornamental species.</p>

<p>Proceeding to the next order, that of the Pigeons (Columb&aelig;), we find
the number of Argentine species to be slightly below the average.
Several fine Pigeons and Doves are well-known inhabitants of the
Republic, but the Columbine order is not a prominent one within our
limits.</p>

<p>The Gallinaceous birds of the Neotropical Region are about ninety in
number, the greater part of these belonging to the Curassows, Cracid&aelig;,
a family specially adapted for habitation in the extensive forests of the
New World. Four species of Cracid&aelig; have been met with in the
forest-region of Northern Argentina; but the Gallinaceous group as a
whole must be held to be deficient in this part of South America, the
place in Nature which these birds fill in other regions being occupied
here by the more lowly organized Tinamous, of which we shall speak
further on.</p>

<p>The Geranomorph&aelig; of the Argentine Republic are much in excess as
regards the number of species. This arises mainly from the abundant
supply of Rails and Crakes which Nature has provided for the more
swampy districts of the pampas, and to the presence of no less than three<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">-&nbsp;xxii&nbsp;-</a>
distinct species of Coots (<i>Fulica</i>), which appear to be generally abundant
on the lakes and pools. Nor must we forget to mention as of special
interest the two Cariamas which belong to this order, and which are the
only representatives of a family of very peculiar structure. One of the
two Cariamas is, so far as we know, absolutely confined to the Northern
provinces of the Argentine Republic; the second is a bird of the campos
of Southern Brazil, which only just comes within our limits.</p>

<p>The Snipes and Plovers and their allies, constituting the Order Limicol&aelig;,
are again in excess in the Argentine Avifauna, not less than 25
out of a known total of 73 Neotropical species having been already met
with within our limits. A large proportion, however, of these birds are
merely winter visitors, and breed only in the far north. On the other
hand, the Slender-billed Plover (<i>Oreophilus ruficollis</i>) and the Winter
Plover (<i>Eudromias modesta</i>) are species highly characteristic of the
Patagonian subregion, and come to the neighbourhood of Buenos Ayres
from a contrary direction. Another especially characteristic Patagonian
family of this order is the Thinocorid&aelig; or Seed-Snipes, of which two
species occur within our limits.</p>

<p>Of the Gavi&aelig;, or Gulls and Terns, of the Argentine Republic, nine
species are already known out of a total of 53 Neotropical members of
the group, and additions no doubt will be made to the list when the
coast-birds of La Plata come to be better known.</p>

<p>The seventeenth order of Birds, Pygopodes, is represented in the
Argentine Ornis by five species of Grebes. Two of these are widely
diffused over all America, the remaining three are Antarctic species
belonging to the Patagonian subregion. As only nine species of this
groups are known to occur in the whole Neotropical Region, the Pygopodes
are highly in excess in the Argentine Avifauna.</p>

<p>The Impennes, or Penguins, which form the eighteenth order of birds,
according to the arrangement of the &lsquo;Nomenclator,&rsquo; are a group specially
characteristic of high Antarctic latitudes. Nine species of Penguins
occur on the coasts of Antarctic America, but one of these only is as yet
known to reach so far north as our limits.</p>

<p>We now come to the Crypturi or Tinamous, an order of birds commonly
supposed to be Gallinaceous, and generally confounded with
&ldquo;Partridges&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pheasants&rdquo; in the vernacular. They are, however,
in some points of essential structure more nearly allied to the Struthiones,
although they doubtless fill the same place in the economy of
Neotropical Nature as the true Gallinaceous birds in other lands. The<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">-&nbsp;xxiii&nbsp;-</a>
Tinamous are spread all over the Neotropical Region and number about
36 species. Eight of these occur within the Argentine Republic; and
amongst them we may pick out the Martineta Tinamou (<i>Calodromas
elegans</i>) and the three species of the genus <i>Nothura</i> as being specially
characteristic Patagonian types.</p>

<p>Lastly, we come to the final order of the Neotropical Ornis in the
shape of the Rheas, or the American representatives of the Ostrich-type
of bird-life. The Rhea is, above all other birds, a most characteristic
representative of the Avifauna of the Patagonian subregion. It is true
that it ranges far north throughout the campos of Inner Brazil, where the
outlying members have become developed into an almost distinct species
or subspecies, <i>Rhea americana macrorhyncha</i>. But south of the Rio
Negro of Patagonia another very distinct type of Rhea, almost subgenerically
different, is met with and extends thence to the Straits of
Magellan. <i>Rhea</i> has also been lately ascertained to occur on the western
side of the Andes in the Chilian province of Tarapaco; so that this fine
form of bird-life is diffused nearly over the entire Patagonian subregion,
and is well entitled to be termed one of the most characteristic features
of the Patagonian Avifauna.</p>

<p>In conclusion, therefore, we may sum up our present knowledge of
the Argentine Avifauna somewhat as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Argentine Avifauna comprises 434 species of birds, referable to
54 families and genera.</p>

<p>All the twenty Orders of the Neotropical Avifauna have representatives
within its boundaries, except the <i>Opisthocomi</i> or Hoatzins, which
are restricted to the Amazonian subregion.</p>

<p>The most numerous families of the Argentine Avifauna are, among
the Passeres, the Finches with 46 species, the Tyrants with 63 species,
and the Wood-hewers with 46 species. Among the remaining Orders,
the Diurnal Birds of Prey with 19 species, the Waterfowl with 22
species, the Rails with 13 species, the Snipes with 15 species, and the
Tinamous with 8 species, are likewise well represented.</p>

<p>Genera characteristic and proportionately numerous in species in the
Argentine Avifauna are <i>Poospiza</i> and <i>Phrygilus</i> among the Finches,
<i>T&aelig;nioptera</i> and <i>Cnipolegus</i> among the Tyrants, <i>Synallaxis</i> among the
Wood-hewers, <i>Fulica</i> among the Rails, and <i>Nothura</i> among the Tinamous.
Less numerous in species, but highly characteristic forms of the
Argentine Ornis, are <i>Thinocorus</i>, <i>Rhynchotis</i>, and <i>Rhea</i>.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">-&nbsp;xxiv&nbsp;-</a>The
following ten genera, mostly monotypic, are, so far as we know
at present, restricted to the limits of the Argentine Avifauna or its
immediate confines:&mdash;<i>Donacospiza</i> and <i>Saltatricula</i> (Fringillid&aelig;);
<i>Coryphistera</i>, <i>Anumbius</i>, <i>Limnornis</i>, and <i>Drymornis</i> (Dendrocolaptid&aelig;);
<i>Rhinocrypta</i>, with two species (Pteroptochid&aelig;); <i>Spiziapteryx</i> (Falconid&aelig;);
<i>Chunga</i> (Cariamid&aelig;); and <i>Calodromas</i> (Tinamid&aelig;).</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Eastern South America, from Cayenne to Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_2" id="Page_2">-&nbsp;2&nbsp;-</a>The
Dusky Thrush is widely distributed in South America, and ranges
as far south as Buenos Ayres, where it is quite common in the woods
along the Plata river. It is a shy forest-bird; a fruit- and insect-eater;
abrupt in its motions; runs rapidly on the ground with beak elevated,
and at intervals pauses and shakes its tail; pugnacious in temper;
strong on the wing, its flight not being over the trees, but masked by
their shadows. It can always be easily distinguished, even at a distance,
from other species by its peculiar short, metallic chirp&mdash;a melodious
sound indicating alarm or curiosity, and uttered before flight&mdash;in contrast
to the harsh screams and chuckling notes of other Thrushes in
this district.</p>

<p>Whether it is a fine singer or not within the tropics I am unable to say,
its vocal powers having received no attention from the naturalists who
have observed it. With us in the temperate climate of Buenos Ayres,
where it commences to sing in September, it has the finest song of any
bird I know, excepting only <i>Mimus triurus</i>. Like the English Song-Thrush,
but unlike its near neighbours the Red-bellied Thrush and the
Magellanic Thrush, it perches on the summit of a tree to sing. Its song
is, however, utterly unlike that of the English bird, which is so fragmentary,
and, as Mr. Barrows describes it, made up of &ldquo;vocal
attitudes and poses.&rdquo; The two birds differ also in voice as much as in
manner. The strains of the Dusky Thrush are poured forth in a continuous
stream, with all the hurry and freedom of the Sky-Lark&rsquo;s song;
but though so rapidly uttered, every note is distinct and clear, and the
voice singularly sweet and far-reaching. At intervals in the song there
recurs a two-syllabled note twice repeated, unlike in sound any other
bird-music I have heard, for it is purely metallic, and its joyous bell-like
&ldquo;<i>te-ling te-ling</i>&rdquo; always comes like a delightful surprise to the
listener, being in strange contrast with the prevailing tone.</p>

<p>The song is altogether a very fine one, its peculiar charm being that
it seems to combine two opposite qualities of bird-music, plaintiveness
and joyousness, in some indefinable manner.</p>

<p>I have never heard this species sing in a cage or anywhere near a
human habitation; and it is probably owing to its recluse habits that
its excellent song has not been hitherto noticed. Azara perhaps mistook
the song of this species for that of <i>Turdus rufiventris</i>, a very inferior
vocalist.</p>

<p>The nest is made in the centre of a thick bush or tree six or eight
feet above the ground, and is a deep elaborate structure, plastered inside
with mud, and lined with soft dry grass. The eggs are four in number,
oblong; the ground-colour light blue, abundantly marked with reddish-brown
spots.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_3" id="Page_3">-&nbsp;3&nbsp;-</a>This
Thrush has, I believe, a partial migration in Buenos Ayres. In
the autumn and winter I have frequently observed it in localities where
it is never seen in summer.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> S.E. Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and La Plata.</p>

<p>The Red-bellied Thrush, distinguished from the species just described
by its larger size and the bright rufous colour of its under plumage, is
common everywhere in the Plata region, and does not appear to be
migratory. It is a noisy, strong-winged, quarrelsome bird, closely
resembling the Dusky Thrush in its manners. It inhabits forests, runs
on the ground in search of food, and when approached darts away with
loud chuckling notes, flying close to the ground. These birds are also often
seen pursuing each other through the trees with loud harsh screams.</p>

<p>The song has a faint resemblance to that of the English Song-Thrush,
being composed of a variety of notes uttered in the same disconnected
manner, with frequent pauses; but it is, both in sweetness and
strength, inferior to that of the English bird. As a rule this Thrush
sings concealed in a thick bush or tree.</p>

<p>The nest is deep, well made, plastered inside with mud, and concealed
in the centre of a large bush or low tree. The eggs are four, pale blue
in colour, and thickly spotted with brown.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Patagonia and Chili.</p>

<p>This Thrush, which I met with on the Rio Negro of Patagonia, so
closely approximates to <i>T. rufiventris</i> in colour, language, and habits,
that the casual observer finds it difficult to distinguish one from the
other. Its nest and eggs are also precisely like those of its northern
representative. The song is, however, much poorer, and reminds one
of the first attempts of a young bird. That a member of so melodious
a family should have so inferior a song I attribute to the fact that
Thrushes (unlike the songsters of other genera) sing only in the warm
season and when the air is calm. In the southern portion of the
South-American continent violent winds prevail in summer, so that this
southern Thrush sings perhaps less frequently than any other song-bird,
and appears to be losing the faculty of song altogether.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentine Republic.</p>

<p>Azara has not failed to remark that it would be well to find a more
appropriate name for this species, which was absurdly called &ldquo;Calandria&rdquo;
(<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Sky-Lark) by the early colonists of the Plata. Use is, however,
too strong to be easily set aside, and the name is now familiar to everyone
in the Argentine Province. Moreover, by a curious irony of fate, the
Spanish naturalist himself, by employing this unsuitable name in his
&lsquo;Apuntamientos,&rsquo; even while protesting against it, has been the cause
of its introduction into scientific nomenclature.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to improve on the account Azara gives of the
bird&rsquo;s appearance and manners. The prevailing colour of the plumage
is grey, the irides are deep green, the beak black, slender, and curved.
The tail is long, jerked and elevated when the bird is at rest, spread
open and depressed in flight. The Calandria&rsquo;s movements are measured
and dignified, its flight low and never extends far, the bird usually
passing from one tree to another in a long graceful curve. It goes
alone or with its mate only; feeds chiefly on the ground; does not
penetrate into deep forests, nor is it seen on the treeless plains. It
frequents the borders of woods and open grounds abounding in isolated
shrubs and trees; is fond of coming about houses, and invariably
perches itself on the most conspicuous places. It sings chiefly in
spring, and its really wonderful vocal powers have made it one of our
best-known and most-admired songsters. To sing it usually places<a class="pagenum" name="Page_6" id="Page_6">-&nbsp;6&nbsp;-</a>
itself on the summit of a bush or tree, and occasionally, as if carried
away by excitement, it darts upwards three or four yards into the air,
and then drops back on to its perch. So varied are its notes, and so
frequently suggestive of the language of other species, that the listener
finds himself continually asking whether the Calandria is really an
original singer or merely a cunning plagiarist, able to steal scraps of
fifty different melodies and to blend them in some sort into one complete
composition. As a whole the song is in character utterly unlike that of
any other bird (birds of the <i>Mimus</i> genus, of course, excepted), for the
same notes are never repeated twice in the same order; and though the
Calandria has many favourite notes, he is able to vary every one of
them a hundred ways. Sometimes the whole song seems to be made
up of imitations of other singers, with slight variations&mdash;and not of
singers only, for now there will be clear flute-like notes, only to be
succeeded by others reedy and querulous as the hunger-calls of a young
Finch; then there will be pretty flourishes or Thrush-like phrases, and
afterwards screams, as of a frightened Swallow hurrying through the
sky to announce the approach of a Falcon; or perhaps piteous outcries,
as of a chicken in the clutches of a Kite.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Azara says truly that the Calandria does not mock or
mimic the songs of other birds; for though the style and intonation of
a score of different singers, chatterers, and screamers are reproduced by
him, one can never catch a song, or even a portion of a song, of which
he is able to say that it is absolutely like that of any other species.
This much, however, can be said of the Calandria: he has a passion for
endless variety in singing, a capacity for varying his tones to almost
any extent, and a facility for catching the notes of other birds, which,
in the Virginian Mocking-bird of North, and in the White-banded
Mocking-bird of South America, has been developed into that marvellous
faculty these two species possess of faithfully imitating the songs of all
other birds. The two species I have just named, while mockers of the
songs of other birds, also retain their own original music&mdash;their &ldquo;natural
song,&rdquo; as an American ornithologist calls it.</p>

<p>The Calandria makes its nest in the middle of a large bush or low
thorn-tree standing by itself; it is deep, like the nest of a Thrush in
form, built of sticks, thorns, and grass, and lined with thistle-down or
some other soft material. The eggs are four or five, pale blue, and
thickly marked with reddish-brown spots.</p>

<p>When the nest is approached the parent birds demonstrate their
anxiety by uttering loud harsh angry notes.</p>

<p>It is generally believed that the Calandria will not live in captivity.
I have, however, seen a few individuals in cages, but they never sang.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Northern Patagonia.</p>

<p>The Patagonian Mocking-bird, which I met with during my sojourn
on the Rio Negro of Patagonia in 1871, closely resembles the species just
described, but is smaller, the plumage is of a darker grey, and the irides
are also of a darker green. It is a common bird, resident, lives alone or
with its mate, feeds on insects and berries, and in its manner of flight
and habits is like <i>Mimus modulator</i>. The nest is made in the centre of
a bush of thorns and sticks, and lined with dry grass, cow-hair, or other
soft material; and the eggs are four in number, bluntly pointed, and
thickly marked with dark flesh-coloured spots. When the nest is
approached the parent birds come close to the intruder, often perching
within a yard of his head, but without uttering any sound, differing in
this respect from <i>M. modulator</i>.</p>

<p>The song of the Patagonian bird is in character like that of the
northern species, the variety of its notes being apparently infinite; there
are, however, some differences worth mentioning. The singing of the
Patagonian species is perhaps inferior, his voice being less powerful, while
his mellow and clear notes are constantly mingled with shrill ones, resembling
the cries of some of the Dendrocolaptine birds. While incapable
of notes so loud or so harsh as those of the northern bird, or of changes so
wild and sudden, he possesses even a greater variety of soft notes. Day
after day for many months I have heard them singing, yet never once
listened to them for any length of time without hearing some note or
phrase I had never heard before. The remarks I have made concerning
the Calandria&rsquo;s mocking-faculties also apply to this bird: but though
he does not actually repeat the notes and songs of other species, he
certainly does mock the notes of individuals of his own species; for
it must be borne in mind that no two individuals sing quite alike, and
that the same bird constantly introduces new notes into his song, and
never repeats his notes in the same order. I have often observed that
when a bird, while singing, emits a few of these <i>new</i> notes, he seems<a class="pagenum" name="Page_8" id="Page_8">-&nbsp;8&nbsp;-</a>
surprised and delighted with them; for, after a silent pause, he repeats
them again and again a vast number of times, as if to impress them on
his memory. When he once more resumes his varied singing, for hours,
and sometimes for days, the expression he has discovered is still a
favourite one, and recurs with the greatest frequency. But this is not
all. If the new note or phrase happens to be a very striking one, it
immediately takes the fancy of all the other birds within hearing, and
often in a small thicket there will be a dozen or twenty birds near
together, each sitting perched on the summit of his own bush. After
the new wonderful note has been sounded they all become silent and
attentive, reminding one in their manner of a caged Parrot listening to
a sound it is trying to learn. Presently they learn it, and are as pleased
with its acquisition as if they had discovered it themselves, repeating it
incessantly. I noticed this curious habit of the bird many times, and
on one occasion I found that for three entire days all the birds in a
small thicket I used to visit every day did nothing but repeat incessantly
two or three singular notes which they had borrowed from one
of their number. The constant repetition of this one sound had a
strongly irritating effect on me; but a day or two later they had apparently
got tired of it themselves, and had resumed their usual varied
singing.</p>

<p>This bird usually sits still upon the summit of a bush when singing,
and its music is heard in all seasons and in all weathers from dawn
till after dark: as a rule it sings in a leisurely unexcited manner,
remaining silent for some time after every five or six or a dozen notes,
and apparently listening to his brother-performers. These snatches of
melody often seem like a prelude or promise of something better coming;
there is often in them such exquisite sweetness and so much variety
that the hearer is ever wishing for a fuller measure, and still the bird
opens his bill to delight and disappoint him, as if not yet ready to
display his whole power.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Paraguay, Argentine Republic, and Bolivia.</p>

<p>Azara first met with this king of the Mocking-birds in Paraguay a
century ago; he named it &ldquo;Calandria de las tres colas,&rdquo; and described
the plumage accurately, but was, I think, mistaken about the colour of
the eye, which is orange-red and not olive-green. He says that it is a
rare species, possessing no melodious notes, which proves at once that
he never heard it sing. D&rsquo;Orbigny obtained it in Bolivia, Bridges in
Mendoza, and more recently it his been found by collectors in various
parts of the Argentine country, even in Buenos Ayres, where, however,
it is probably only an occasional visitor. But they have told us nothing
of its song and of its miraculous mocking-powers. For my part I can
think of no other way to describe the surpassing excellence of its
melody, which delights the soul beyond all other bird-music, than by
saying that this bird is among song-birds like the diamond among
stones, which in its many-coloured splendour represents and exceeds
the special beauty of every other gem.</p>

<p>I met with this species on the Rio Negro in Patagonia: it was there
called <i>Calandria blanca</i>, a name not strictly accurate, since the bird is
not all white, but certainly better than Azara&rsquo;s strange invention of
&ldquo;Lark with three tails.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bird was not common in Patagonia, and its only language was a
very loud harsh startled note, resembling that of the <i>Mimus calandria</i>;
but it was past the love-season when I first met with it, and the natives
all assured me that it possessed a very wonderful song, surpassing the
songs of all other birds; also that it had the faculty of imitating other
species. In manners and appearance it struck me as being utterly
unlike a <i>Mimus</i>; in its flight and in the conspicuous white and black
of the wings and tail, it looked like a Tyrant of the <i>T&aelig;nioptera</i> group.
It was extremely shy, had a swift, easy, powerful flight, and, when
approached, would rise up high in the air and soar away to a great
distance. In February it disappeared from the Rio Negro and did not
return till the following October, after the arrival of all the other
migrants. It was then that I had the rare good fortune to hear it sing,
and I shall never forget the sensation I experienced when listening to its
matchless melody.</p>

<p>While walking through a <i>cha&ntilde;ar</i>-wood one bright morning, my attention
was suddenly arrested by notes issuing from a thicket close by, and
to which I listened in delighted astonishment, so vastly superior in
melody, strength, and variety did they seem to all other bird-music.
That it was the song of a <i>Mimus</i> did not occur to me; for while the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_10" id="Page_10">-&nbsp;10&nbsp;-</a>
music came in a continuous stream, until I marvelled that the throat of
any bird could sustain so powerful and varied a song for so long a time,
it was never once degraded by the harsh cries, fantastical flights, and
squealing buffooneries so frequently introduced by the Calandria, but
every note was in harmony and uttered with a rapidity and joyous
abandon no other bird is capable of, except, perhaps, the Sky-Lark;
while the purity of the sounds gave to the whole performance something
of the ethereal rapturous character of the Lark&rsquo;s song when it comes
to the listener from a great height in the air.</p>

<p>Presently this flow of exquisite unfamiliar music ceased, while I still
remained standing amongst the trees, not daring to move for fear of
scaring away the strange vocalist. After a short interval of silence I
had a fresh surprise. From the very spot whence that torrent of melody
had issued, burst out the shrill, confused, impetuous song of the small
yellow-and-grey Patagonian Flycatcher (<i>Stigmatura flavo-cinerea</i>). It
irritated me to hear this familiar and trivial song after the other, and I
began to fear that my entertainer had flown away unobserved. But in
another moment, from the same spot, came the mellow matin-song of
the Diuca Finch, and this was quickly succeeded by the silvery bell-like
trilling song of the <a name="Churinche" id="Churinche">Churinche</a>, or little Scarlet Tyrant-bird. Then followed
many other familiar notes and songs&mdash;the flute-like evening-call
of the Crested Tinamou, the gay hurried twittering of the Black-headed
Goldfinch, and the leisurely-uttered, delicious strains of the Yellow
Cardinal, all repeated with miraculous fidelity. How much was my
wonder and admiration increased by the discovery that my one sweet
singer had produced all these diverse strains! The discovery was
only made when he began to repeat songs of species that never visit
Patagonia. I knew then that I was at last listening to the famed
White Mocking-bird, just returned from his winter travels, and repeating
in this southern region the notes he had acquired in subtropical
forests a thousand miles away.</p>

<p>These imitations at length ceased, after which the sweet vocalist
resumed his own matchless song once more. I ventured then to creep a
little nearer, and at length caught sight of him not fifteen yards away.
I then found that the pleasure of listening to its melody was greatly
enhanced when I could at the same time see the bird, so carried away
with rapture does he seem while singing, so many and so beautiful are
the gestures and motions with which his notes are accompanied. He
passes incessantly from bush to bush, scarcely alighting on their summits,
and at times dropping down beneath the foliage; then, at intervals,
soaring to a height of a hundred feet above the thicket, with a flight
slow as that of a Heron, or mounting suddenly upwards with a wild,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_11" id="Page_11">-&nbsp;11&nbsp;-</a>hurried, zigzag motion; then slowly circling downwards, to sit with tail
outspread and the broad glistening white wings expanded, or languidly
waved up and down like the wings of some great butterfly&mdash;an object
beautiful to see.</p>

<p>When I first heard this bird sing I felt convinced that no other
feathered songster on the globe could compare with it; for besides the
faculty of reproducing the songs of other species, which it possesses in
common with the Virginian Mocking-bird, it has a song of its own,
which I believed matchless; and in this belief I was confirmed when,
shortly after hearing it, I visited England, and found of how much less
account than this Patagonian bird, which no poet has ever praised, were
the sweetest of the famed melodists of the Old World.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_14" id="Page_14">-&nbsp;14&nbsp;-</a>The common
Argentine Wren is to all English residents the &ldquo;House-Wren,&rdquo;
and is considered to be identical with the species familiar to
them in their own country. It is a sprightly little bird, of a uniform
brown colour and a cheerful melodious voice; a tireless hunter after
small spiders and caterpillars in hedges, gardens, and outhouses, where
it explores every dark hole and cranny, hopping briskly about with tail
erect, and dropping frequent little curtsies; always prompt to scold an
intruder with great emphasis; a great hater of cats.</p>

<p>It was my belief at one time that the Wren was one of the little birds
a cat never could catch; but later on I discovered that this was a
mistake. At my home on the pampas we once had a large yellow tom
cat exceedingly dexterous in catching small birds; he did not, however,
eat them himself, but used to bring them into the house for the other
cats. Two or three times a day he would appear with a bird, which he
would drop at the door, then utter a loud mew very well understood by
the other cats, for they would all fly to the spot in great haste, and the
first to arrive would get the bird. At one time I noticed that he
brought in a Wren almost every day, and, curious to know how he
managed to capture so clever a bird, I watched him. His method was
to go out into the grounds frequented by Wrens, and seat himself
conspicuously amongst the weeds or bushes; and then, after the first
burst of alarm had subsided amongst the small birds, one or two Wrens
would always take on themselves the task of dislodging him, or, at all
events, of making his position a very uncomfortable one. The cat
would sit perfectly motionless, apparently not noticing them at all, and
by-and-by this stolid demeanour would have its effect, and one of the
Wrens, growing bolder, would extend his dashing little incursions to
within a few inches of pussy&rsquo;s demure face; then at last, swift as
lightning, would come the stroke of a paw, and the little brown body
would drop down with the merry brave little spirit gone from it.</p>

<p>The House-Wren is widely distributed in South America, from the
tropical forests to the cold uplands of Patagonia, and, possessing a
greater adaptiveness than most species, it inhabits every kind of
country, moist or dry, and is as much at home on lofty mountains and
stony places as in the everglades of the Plata, where it frequents the
reed-beds and damp forests. About houses they are always to be found;
and though the traveller on the desert pampas might easily imagine
that there are no Wrens in the giant grasses, if he makes himself a
lodge in this lonely region, a Wren will immediately appear to make its
nest in his thatch and cheer him with its song.</p>

<p>Even in large towns they are common, and I always remember one
flying into a church in Buenos Ayres one Sunday, and, during the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_15" id="Page_15">-&nbsp;15&nbsp;-</a>
whole sermon-time, pouring out its bright lyric strains from its perch
high up somewhere in the ornamental wood-work of the roof.</p>

<p>The Wren sings all summer, and also on bright days in winter. The
song is not unlike that of the English House-Wren, having the same
gushing character, the notes being strong and clear, and uttered with
rapidity and precision; but the Argentine bird has greater sweetness
and more power.</p>

<p>In spring the male courts his mate with notes high and piercing as
the squeals of a young mouse; these he repeats with great rapidity,
fluttering his wings all the time like a moth, and at intervals breaking
out into song.</p>

<p>The nest is made in a dark hole in a wall or tree, sometimes in the
forsaken domed nest of some other bird; and where such sites are not to
be found, in a dense thistle or thorn-bush, or in a large tussock of grass.
I have also found nests in dry skulls of cows and horses, in an old boot,
in the sleeve of an old coat left hanging on a <i>fence</i>, in a large-necked
bottle, and in various other curious situations. The nest is built of
sticks and lined with horse-hair or feathers, and the eggs are usually

<p>This small Wren is rarely seen, being nowhere common, although
widely distributed. It prefers open grounds covered with dense reeds
and grasses, where it easily escapes observation. I have met with it
near Buenos Ayres city; also on the desert pampas, in the tall pampas-grass.
It is likewise met with along the Paran&aacute; river, and in Chili,
Patagonia, and the Falkland Islands. In the last-named locality
Darwin found it common, and says that it has there an extremely feeble
flight, so that it may easily be run down and taken.</p>

<p>The Marsh-Wren has a sweet and delicate song, resembling that of the
House-Wren (<i>Troglodytes furvus</i>), but much less powerful. It does not
migrate; and on the pampas I have heard it singing with great animation
when the pampas-grass, where it sat perched, was white with frozen dew.
Probably its song, like that of <i>Troglodytes furvus</i>, varies in different
districts; at all events, the pampas bird does not possess so fine a song
as Azara ascribes to his &ldquo;Todo Voz&rdquo; in Paraguay, which is undoubtedly
the same species.</p>

<p>The Wagtails and Pipits are closely-allied forms, and are usually

the Old World, although it has been recently ascertained that some of
them occasionally occur as stragglers in the northern latitudes of
America. Of the almost cosmopolitan Pipits about eight or nine
species are sparingly distributed over the prairies and pampas of the
New World. One of these is a common resident in the pampas of
Argentina, and another (perhaps somewhat doubtful species) is occasionally
met with.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Paraguay, Argentina, Patagonia, and Chili.</p>

<p>Azara&rsquo;s only reason for calling this bird <i>La Correndera</i> was because
he thought it resembled a Tit-Lark known by that name in his own
country, but of which he merely had a confused recollection. It is
therefore to be regretted, I think, that <i>correndera</i> has been adopted as
a specific name by naturalists instead of &ldquo;Cachila,&rdquo; the vernacular
name of the bird, familiar to every one in the Argentine country.
Azara&rsquo;s Spanish bird was probably <i>Anthus pratensis</i>, which closely resembles
<i>A. correndera</i> in general appearance, and has, moreover, as wide
a range in the northern as the last-named species has in the southern
hemisphere. In the volume on Birds in the &lsquo;Voyage of the Beagle,&rsquo; it
is said that a species of <i>Anthus</i> ranges further south than any other
land-bird, being the only land-bird found on Georgia and South Orkney
(lat. 61&deg; S.).</p>

<p>In colour and language, possibly also in size, the Cachila is variable.
It is a very common bird, widely and plentifully distributed over the
pampas, found alike on marshy and dry grounds, but rare in the region
of giant grasses. While abundant, it is also very evenly dispersed, each
bird spending its life on a very circumscribed plot of earth. Those
frequenting marshy or moist grounds are of a yellowish-cream colour,
thickly mottled and striped with fuscous and black, and have two
narrow parallel pure white marks on the back, very conspicuous when
the bird is on the ground. The individuals frequenting high and dry
grounds are much paler in hue, appearing almost grey, and do not show
the white marks on the back. They also look larger than the birds on
marshy lands; but this appearance is probably due to a looser plumage.
The most strongly-marked pale and dark-plumaged variations may be<a class="pagenum" name="Page_18" id="Page_18">-&nbsp;18&nbsp;-</a>
found living within a few hundred yards of each other, showing how
strictly each bird keeps to its own little &ldquo;beat&rdquo;; for this difference in
coloration is, no doubt, due entirely to the amount of moisture in the
ground they live on.</p>

<p>The Cachilas are resident, living in couples all the year round, the
sexes being faithful. Several pairs frequent a small area, and sometimes
they unite in a desultory flock; but these gatherings are not frequent.
In the evening, at all seasons, immediately after the sun has set, the
Cachilas all rise to a considerable height in the air and fly wildly about,
chirping for a few minutes, after which they retire to roost.</p>

<p>When approached they frequently rise up several feet from the ground
and flutter in the air, chirping sharply, with breast towards the intruder.
This is a habit also found in Synallaxine species inhabiting the grassy
plains. But, as a rule, the Cachilas are the tamest of feathered
creatures, and usually creep reluctantly away on their little pink feet
when approached. If the pedestrian is a stranger to their habits they
easily delude him into attempting their capture with his hat, so little is
their fear of man.</p>

<p>To sing, the Cachila mounts upwards almost vertically, making at
intervals a fluttering pause, accompanied with a few hurried notes.
When he has thus risen to a great height (but never beyond sight as
Azara says) he begins the descent slowly, the wings inclining upwards;
and, descending, he pours forth long impressive strains, each ending
with a falling inflection or with two or three short throat-notes as the
bird pauses fluttering in mid-air, and then renewed successively until,
when the singer is within 3 or 4 feet of the earth, without alighting he
reascends as before to continue the performance. It is a very charming
melody, and heard always on the treeless plains when there is no other
bird-music, with the exception of the trilling and grasshopper-like notes
of a few Synallaxine species. But in character it is utterly unlike the
song of the Sky-Lark with its boundless energy, hurry, and abandon;
and yet it is impossible not to think of the Sky-Lark when describing
the Cachila, which, in its manners, appearance, and in its habit of
soaring to a great height when singing, seems so like a small copy of
that bird.</p>

<p>The Cachila rears two broods in the year; the first is hatched about
the middle of August, that is, one to three months before the laying-season
of other Passerine species. By anticipating the breeding-season
their early nests escape the evil of parasitical eggs; but, on the other
hand, frosty nights and heavy rains are probably as fatal to as many
early broods as the instinct of the <i>Molothrus bonariensis</i>, or Cow-bird,
is to others at a later period.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_19" id="Page_19">-&nbsp;19&nbsp;-</a>The second
brood is reared in December, the hottest month, and in
that season a large proportion of their nests contain parasitical eggs.</p>

<p>The nest is placed in a slight hollow in the ground, under a tussock
of grass, and is sometimes elaborately made and lined with horsehair
and fine grass, and sometimes with a few materials loosely put together.
During the solstitial heats I have frequently found nests with frail
shades, built of sticks and grass, over them, the short withered grass
affording an insufficient protection from the meridian sun. The eggs
are four, elongated, with a dirty white and sometimes a dull bluish
ground, thickly spotted with dusky brown and drab. In some eggs the
spots are confluent, the whole shell being of a dull brownish-drab colour.</p>

<p>The manners of this species, where I have observed it, are always the
same; it lives on the ground on open plains, where the herbage and
grass is short, and never perches on trees. The song varies considerably
in different districts.</p>

in Eastern Argentina is quite probable. Whether the bird is really
distinct from the widespread <i>Vireo olivaceus</i> seems to be a question

<p>Azara, describing this species, says it is one of the commonest in deep
woods, where it moves about among the terminal twigs, without ever
rising to the tops of the trees or flying down to the brush or the ground.
It is active, and extremely restless in manner; and in searching after
and taking the small insects and spiders on which it lives it climbs
about the twigs, assuming every position, and frequently suspending
itself, head downwards, by its feet. It has a full pleasing voice of considerable
power, heard incessantly in the woods, particularly in the love-season.
The nest is a slender beautiful structure, even surpassing that
of the Humming-birds, constructed of thin dry leaves outside, smoothly
attached to the rest with spiders&rsquo; webs, while the inside is formed of
fine fibres and cotton.</p>

Plata, and may be easily known to any person penetrating them by its
loud &ldquo;cheerful soliloquy,&rdquo; for that phrase of Mr. Barrows, the North-American
writer on birds, well describes the artless, light-hearted song
which it utters at intervals while it roams about in the deep foliage,
and which reminds one of the careless whistling of a boy, whistling
merely to express his gaiety, but without having any particular tune
in his mind. It is migratory, and extends its range south of Buenos
Ayres.</p>

<p>The Purple Martin is occasionally seen in the eastern provinces of
La Plata when migrating, but has not been found nesting anywhere so
far north as Buenos Ayres. I met with it breeding at Bahia Blanca on
the Atlantic coast, and on the Rio Negro, where it is very common.
It arrives in Patagonia late in September, and leaves before the middle
of February. On the 14th of that month I saw one flock flying north,
but it was the last. It breeds in holes under the caves of houses or in
walls, and its nest is like that of <i>P. chalybea</i>; but many also breed in
holes in the steep banks of the Rio Negro. They do not, however,
excavate holes for themselves, but take possession of natural crevices
and old forsaken burrows of the Burrowing Parrot (<i>Conurus patachonicus</i>).
In size, flight, manners, and appearance the Purple Martin
closely resembles the following species, the only difference being in the
dark plumage of the under surface. The language of the two birds is
also identical; the loud excited scream when the nest is approached, the
various other notes when the birds sweep about in the air, and the agreeably
modulated and leisurely-uttered song are all possessed by the two
species without the slightest difference in strength or intonation. This
circumstance appears very remarkable to me, because, though two
species do sometimes possess a few notes alike, the greater part of their
language is generally different; also because birds of the same species
in different localities vary more in language than in any other particular.
This last observation, however, applies more to resident than to migratory
species.</p>

<p>This species, distinguished from the Purple Martin by its white
underparts, ranges from Mexico to Buenos Ayres, the extreme limit of
its range being about 250 miles south of that city. It was well called
<i>Golondrina domestica</i> by Azara, being preeminently domestic in its
habits. It never breeds in banks as the Purple Martin often does, or
in the domed nests of other birds in trees, a situation always resorted
to by the Tree-Martin, and occasionally by the Common Swallow; but
is so accustomed to the companionship of man as to make its home
in populous towns as well as in country-houses. It arrives in Buenos
Ayres about the middle of September, and apparently resorts to the
same breeding-place every year. A hole under the eaves is usually
selected, and the nest is roughly built of dry grass, hair, feathers, and
other materials. When the entrance to its breeding-hole is too large,
it partially closes it up with mud mixed with straw; if there be two
entrances it stops up one altogether. The bird does not often require to
use mud in building; it is the only one of our Swallows that uses such
a material at all. The eggs are white, long, pointed, and five in number.</p>

<p>In the season of courtship this Martin is a noisy pugnacious bird, and
always, when quitting its nest, utters an exceedingly loud startling cry
several times repeated. It also has a song, uttered both when resting
and on the wing, composed of several agreeably modulated notes, and in
that thick rolling intonation peculiar to our Swallows. This song does
not sound loud when near, yet it can be distinctly heard when the bird
appears but a speck in the distance. I may here remark that, with
the exception of the <i>Petrochelidon pyrrhonota</i>, which possesses a sharp
squeaky voice, like the Swallows of Europe, all our Hirundines have
soft voices: their usual twittering when they are circling about resembles
somewhat the chirping of the English House-Sparrow in tone, but
besides these notes they possess a song more pleasing to the ear.</p>

<p>Before leaving in February these birds congregate in parties of from
twenty to four or five hundred, usually on the broad leafy top of an old
omb&uacute; tree.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina.</p>

<p>The Tree-Martin is more slender and has a greater extent of wing
than the Purple Martins; and, instead of the beautiful dark purple
(their prevailing colour), its entire upper plumage is dusky brown, the
under surface white. But if these differences of structure and hue
merely serve to show that it is not a very near relative of the other
species, those exhibited in its habits remove it very far indeed from
them.</p>

<p>The Tree-Martin is a very garrulous bird, and no sooner arrives early
in September, than we are apprised of the circumstance by the notes
which the male and female incessantly sing in concert, fluttering and
waving their wings the while, and seeming quite beside themselves with
joy at their safe arrival; for invariably they arrive already mated.
Their language is more varied, the intonation bolder and freer than that
of our other Swallows. The length of the notes can be varied at
pleasure; some are almost harsh, others silvery or liquid, as of trickling
drops of water; they all have a glad sound; and many have that
peculiar character of some bird-notes of shaping themselves into
words.</p>

<p>This Martin is never seen to alight on the ground or on the
roofs of houses, but solely on trees; and when engaged in collecting
materials for its nest, it sweeps down and snatches up a feather or
straw without touching the surface. It breeds only in the clay-ovens
of the Oven-bird (<i>Furnarius rufus</i>). I, at least, have never seen them
breed in any other situation after observing them for a great many
summers. An extraordinary habit! for, many as are the species that
possess the parasitical tendency of breeding in other birds&rsquo; nests,
none of them confine themselves to the nest of a single species
excepting the bird I am describing. It must, however, be understood
that my knowledge of this bird has been acquired in Buenos Ayres,
where I have observed it; and as this Martin possesses a wider range
in South America than the Oven-birds, it is more than probable that in
other districts it builds in different situations.</p>

<p>On arriving in spring each pair takes up its position on some tree,
and usually on a particular branch; a dead branch extending beyond
the foliage is a favourite perch. Here they spend much of their time,
never appearing to remain long absent from it, and often, when singing<a class="pagenum" name="Page_28" id="Page_28">-&nbsp;28&nbsp;-</a>
their notes together, fluttering about it with a tremulous uncertain
flight, like that of a hovering butterfly. About three weeks after first
arriving they begin to make advances towards the Oven-bird&rsquo;s nest that
stands on the nearest post or tree; and if it be still occupied by the
rightful owners, after much time has been spent in sporting about
and reconnoitring it, a feud begins which is often exceedingly violent
and protracted for many days.</p>

<p>In seasons favourable to them the Oven-birds build in autumn and
winter, and breed early in spring; so that their broods are out of their
clay-houses by the end of October or earlier; when this happens, the
Swallow that breeds in November quietly takes possession of the forsaken
fortress. But accidents will happen, even to the wonderful
fabric of the Oven-bird. It is sometimes destroyed and must be
rebuilt; or its completion has perhaps been retarded for months by
drought, or by the poor condition of the birds in severe weather; or
the first brood has perhaps perished, destroyed by an opossum or other
enemy. November, and even December, may thus arrive before some
pairs have hatched their eggs; and it is these unfortunate late breeders
that suffer from the violence of the marauding Swallows. I have often
witnessed the wars of these birds with the deepest interest; and in
many ovens that I have opened I have found the eggs of the Oven-birds
buried under the nests of the Swallows. After the Swallows have taken
up a position near the coveted oven, they occasionally fly towards and
hover about it, returning again to their stand. By-and-by, instead of
returning as at first, they take to alighting at the entrance of the
coveted home; this is a sort of declaration of war, and marks the
beginning of hostilities. The Oven-birds, full of alarm and anger, rush
upon and repel them as often as they approach; they retire before this
furious onset, but not discomfited, and only warbling out their gay
seemingly derisive notes in answer to the outrageous indignant screams
of their enemies. Soon they return; the scene is repeated; and this
desultory skirmishing is often continued for many days.</p>

<p>But at length the lawless invaders, grown bolder, and familiar with
his strength and resources, will no longer fly from the master of the
house; desperate struggles now frequently take place at the entrance,
the birds again and again dropping to the ground clutched fiercely
together, and again hurrying up only to resume the combat. Victory
at last declares itself for the aggressors, and they busy themselves
carrying in materials for their nest, screaming their jubilant notes all
the time as if in token of triumph. The brave and industrious Oven-birds,
dispossessed of their home, retire to spend their childless summer
together, for the male and female never separate; and when the autumn<a class="pagenum" name="Page_29" id="Page_29">-&nbsp;29&nbsp;-</a>
rains have supplied them with wet clay, and the sense of defeat is worn
off, they cheerfully begin their building-operations afresh.</p>

<p>This is not, however, the invariable result of the conflict. To the
superior swiftness of the Martin the Oven-bird opposes greater strength,
and, it might be added, a greater degree of zeal and fury than can
animate its adversary. The contest is thus nearly an equal one; and
the Oven-bird, particularly when its young are already hatched, is often
able to maintain its own. But the Martins never suffer defeat; for,
when unable to take the citadel by storm, they fall back on their
dribbling system of warfare, which they keep up till the young birds
leave the nest, when they take possession before it has grown cold.</p>

<p>The Martin makes its own nest chiefly of large feathers, and lays
four eggs, long, pointed, and pure white.</p>

<p>It will be remarked that in all its habits above mentioned this bird
differs widely from the two preceding species. It also differs greatly
from them in its manner of flight. The Purple Martins move with
surprising grace and celerity, the wings extended to their utmost; they
also love to sail in circles high up in the air, or about the summits
of tall trees, and particularly during a high wind. At such times
several individuals are usually seen together, and all seem striving to
outvie each other in the beauty of their evolutions.</p>

<p>The Tree-Martin is never seen to soar about in circles; and though
when hawking after flies and moths it sweeps the surface of the grass
with amazing swiftness, at other times it has a flight strangely slow and
of a fashion peculiar to itself: the long wings are depressed as much
as those of a Wild Duck when dropping on to the water, and are constantly
agitated with tremulous flutterings, short and rapid as those
of a butterfly.</p>

<p>Neither is this bird gregarious like all its congeners, though occasionally
an individual associates for a while with Swallows of another
species; but this only when they are resting on fences or trees, for as
soon as they take flight it leaves them. Once or twice, when for some
mysterious cause the autumnal migration has been delayed long past its
usual time, I have seen them unite in small flocks; but this is very
rare. As a rule they have no meetings preparatory to migration, but
skim about the fields and open plains in un-Swallow-like solitude,
and suddenly disappear without having warned us of their intended
departure.</p>

<p>This species does not breed in Buenos Ayres, and is only seen there
in spring, flying south or south-west, and again in much larger numbers
on its return journey in autumn. On the Rio Negro, in Patagonia, I
did not meet with it, and suppose its summer resort must be south of
that locality; and, judging from the immense numbers visible in some
seasons, I should think that they must, in their breeding-place in
Patagonia, occupy a very extensive area. They do not seem to be as
regular in their movements as other Swallows here; some years I have
observed them passing singly or in small parties during the entire hot
season: usually they begin to appear, flying north, in February; but in
some years not until after the middle of March. They are not seen
passing with a rapid flight in close flocks, but straggle about, hawking
after flies: first one bird passing, then two or three, and a minute or
two later half a dozen, and so on for a greater part of the day. So
long as the weather continues warm they journey in this leisurely
manner; but I have known them to continue passing till April, after all
the summer migrants had left us, and these late birds flew by with great
speed in small close flocks, directly north, as if their flight had been
guided by the magnetic needle.</p>

<p>While flying this species continually utters sharp twitterings and

<p><i>Hab.</i> Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>

<p>This is the most abundant and best known of our Swallows; a pretty
bird in its glossy coat of deep green, and rump and under surface
snowy white; exceedingly restless in its disposition, quick and graceful
in its motions; social, quarrelsome, garrulous, with a not unmusical song,
beginning with long, soft, tremulous notes, followed by others shorter
and more hurried, and sinking to a murmur. They are the last of all
our migrants to leave us in autumn, and invariably reappear in small
numbers about the houses on every warm day in winter. Probably many
individuals in Buenos Ayres remain through the winter in sheltered
situations, to scatter over the surrounding country whenever there
comes a warm bright day. I once saw three together, skimming over
the plains, on one of the coldest days I ever experienced on the pampas,
the thermometer having stood at 29&deg; Fahr. that morning.</p>

<p>Further south their migration is more strict; and on the Rio Negro,
in Patagonia, from March to August I did not meet with a single
individual. In Buenos Ayres the autumnal migration of the Hirundines
begins about the middle of February, and from that date vast numbers
of this Swallow are seen travelling north, and, in some seasons, they
continue passing for over a month. One autumn, in April, several days
after the Swallows had all disappeared, flocks of the Common Swallow
began again to appear flying north, and for ten days afterwards they
continued to pass in large numbers. They would stoop to dip themselves
in a pool where I observed them, and then alight on the reeds
and bushes to rest, and appeared quite tired with their journey, rising
reluctantly when approached, and some allowing me to stand almost
within arm&rsquo;s length of them without stirring. I had never before
observed any later or supplementary migration like this; for, as a rule,
the causes which in some years delay the departure of birds seems
to affect them all alike. Possibly these late birds come from some
remote district, where exceptionally cold weather had retarded breeding-operations.</p>

<p>The White-rumped Swallow sometimes lays in a tree, in the large nest,
previously abandoned, of the Le&ntilde;atero (<i>Anumbius acuticaudatus</i>). Its<a class="pagenum" name="Page_32" id="Page_32">-&nbsp;32&nbsp;-</a>
favourite site is, however, a hole in a wall, sheltered by the overhanging
tiles or thatch; for though it does not go much into towns, as
Azara has remarked, it is very domestic, and there is not a house on the
pampas, however humble it be, but some of these birds are about it,
sportively skimming above the roof, or curiously peering under the
eaves, and incessantly uttering their gurgling happy notes.</p>

<p>For a period of a month to six weeks before building begins they
seem to be holding an incessant dispute, reminding one in their scolding
tones of a colony of contentious English House-Sparrows, only the
Swallow has a softer, more varied voice, and frequently, even when
hotly quarrelling, he pauses to warble out his pretty little song, with its
sound like running water. However many eligible chinks and holes
there may be, the contention is always just as great amongst them, and
is doubtless referable to opposing claims to the best places. The excited
twittering, the incessant striving of two birds to alight on the same
square inch of wall, the perpetual chases they lead each other round and
round the house, always ending exactly where they began, tell of
clashing interests and of great unreasonableness on the part of some
amongst them. By-and-by the quarrel assumes a more serious aspect;
friends and neighbours have apparently intervened in vain; all the
arguments of which Swallows are capable have been exhausted, and, a
compromise of claims being more impossible than ever, fighting begins.
Most vindictively do the little things clutch each other and fall to the
earth twenty times an hour, where they often remain struggling for a
long time, heedless of the screams of alarm their fellows set up above
them; for often, while they thus lie on the ground punishing each
other, they fall an easy prey to some wily pussy who has made herself
acquainted with their habits.</p>

<p>When these feuds are finally settled, they address themselves diligently
to the great work and build a rather big nest. They are not
neat or skilful workers, but merely stuff a great quantity of straw and
other light materials into the breeding-hole, and line the nest with
feathers and horsehair. On this soft but disorderly bed the female lays
from five to seven pure white eggs.</p>

<p>All those species that are liable at any time to become the victims of
raptorial birds are very much beholden to this Swallow, as he is the
most vigilant sentinel they possess. When the hurrying Falcon is still
far off, and the other birds unsuspicious of his approach, the Swallows
suddenly rush up into the sky with a wild rapid flight to announce the
evil tidings with distracted screams. The alarm spreads swift as light
through the feathered tribes, which, on all sides, are in terrified
commotion, crouching in the grass, plunging into thickets, or mounting<a class="pagenum" name="Page_33" id="Page_33">-&nbsp;33&nbsp;-</a>
upwards to escape by flight. I have often wondered at this, since this
swift-winged and quick-doubling little bird is the least likely to fall a
prey himself.</p>

<p>They possess another habit very grateful to the mind of every early
riser. At the first indication of dawn, and before any other wild bird
has broken the profound silence of night, multitudes of this Swallow, as
if at the signal of a leader, begin their singing and twittering, at the same
time mounting upwards into the quiet dusky sky. Their notes at this
hour differ from the hurried twittering uttered during the day, being
softer and more prolonged, and, sounding far up in the sky from so
many throats, the concert has a very charming effect, and seems in harmony
with the shadowy morning twilight.</p>

<p>This diminutive dark-plumaged species is the smallest of our Hirundines.
In Buenos Ayres they appear early in September, arriving before
the Martins, but preceded by the Common Swallow. They are bank-birds,
breeding in forsaken holes and burrows, for they never bore into
the earth themselves, and are consequently not much seen about the
habitations of man. They sometimes find their breeding-holes in the
banks of streams, or, in cultivated districts, in the sides of ditches, and
even down in wells. But if in such sites alone fit receptacles for their
eggs were met with, the species, instead of one of the commonest, would
be rare indeed with us; for on the level pampas most of the water-courses
have marshy borders, or at most but low and gently sloping
banks. But the burrowing habits of two other animals&mdash;the Vizcacha
(<i>Lagostomus trichodactylus</i>), the common large rodent of the pampas,
and the curious little bird called Minera (<i>Geositta cunicularia</i>)&mdash;have<a class="pagenum" name="Page_34" id="Page_34">-&nbsp;34&nbsp;-</a>
everywhere afforded the Swallows abundance of breeding-places on the
plains, even where there are no streams or other irregularities in
the smooth surface of the earth.</p>

<p>The Minera bores its hole in the sides of the Vizcacha&rsquo;s great burrow,
and in this burrow within a burrow the Swallow lays its eggs and rears
its young, and is the guest of the Vizcacha, and as much dependent on
it as the House-Wren and the Domestic Swallow on man; so that in
spring, when this species returns to the plains, it is in the villages of
the Vizcachas that we see them. There they live and spend the day,
sporting about the burrows, just as the Common Swallow does about our
houses; and to a stranger on the pampas one of these villages, with its
incongruous bird and mammalian inhabitants, must seem a very curious
sight in the evening. Before sunset the old male Vizcachas come forth to
sit gravely at the mouths of their great burrows. One or two couples
of Mineras, their little brown bird-tenants, are always seen running
about on the bare ground round the holes, resting at intervals with their
tails slowly moving up and down, and occasionally trilling-out their
shrill laughter-like cry. Often a pair of Burrowing-Owls also live in
the village, occupying one of the lesser disused burrows; and round
them all flit half a dozen little Swallows, like twilight-moths with long
black wings. It is never quite a happy family, however, for the Owls
always hiss and snap at a Vizcacha if he comes too near; while the
little Swallows never become reconciled to the Owls, but perpetually
flutter about them, protesting against their presence with long
complaining notes.</p>

<p>The nest, made of dry grass lined with feathers, is placed at the
extremity of the long, straight, cylindrical burrow, and contains five or
six white pointed eggs. I have never seen these Swallows fighting with
the Minera to obtain possession of the burrows, for this industrious little
bird makes itself a fresh one every spring, so that there are always
houses enough for the Swallows. After the young have flown, they sit
huddled together on a weed or thistle-top, and the parents continue to
feed them for many days.</p>

<p>As in size and brightness of plumage, so in language is the Bank-Swallow
inferior to other species, its only song being a single, weak,
trilling note, much prolonged, which the bird repeats with great
frequency when on the wing. Its voice has ever a mournful, monotonous
sound, and even when it is greatly excited and alarmed, as at
the approach of a fox or hawk, its notes are neither loud nor shrill.
When flying they glide along close to the earth, and frequently alight
on the ground to rest, which is contrary to the custom of other
Swallows. Like other species of this family, they possess the habit of<a class="pagenum" name="Page_35" id="Page_35">-&nbsp;35&nbsp;-</a>
gliding to and fro before a traveller&rsquo;s horse, to catch the small twilight-moths
driven up from the grass. A person riding on the pampas usually
has a number of Swallows flying round him, and I have often thought
that more than a hundred were before my horse at one time; but, from
the rapidity of their motions, it is impossible to count them. I have
frequently noticed individuals of the four most common species following
me together; but after sunset, and when the other species have long
forsaken the open grassy plain for the shelter of trees and houses, the
diminutive Bank-Swallow continues to keep the traveller company. At
such a time, as they glide about in the dusk of evening, conversing
together in low tremulous tones, they have a peculiarly sorrowful appearance,
seeming like homeless little wanderers over the great level plains.</p>

<p>When the season of migration approaches they begin to congregate
in parties not very large, though sometimes as many as one or two
hundred individuals are seen together; these companies spend much of
their time perched close together on weeds, low trees, fences, or other
slightly elevated situations, and pay little heed to a person approaching,
but seem preoccupied or preyed upon by some trouble that has no
visible cause.</p>

<p>The time immediately preceding the departure of the Swallows is
indeed a season of very deep interest to the observer of nature. The
birds in many cases seem to forget the attachment of the sexes and
their songs and aerial recreations; they already begin to feel the premonitions
of that marvellous instinct that urges them hence: not yet
an irresistible impulse, it is a vague sense of disquiet; but its influence
is manifest in their language and gestures, their wild manner of flight,
and their listless intervals.</p>

<p>The little Bank-Swallow disappears immediately after the Martins.
Many stragglers continue to be seen after the departure of the main
body; but before the middle of March not one remains, the migration
of this species being very regular.</p>

<br />

<p>The brilliant family of Tanagers, one of the most characteristic groups
of the American avifauna, contains altogether nearly 400 species, of
which the greater number are restricted to the forest-clad districts of
Central and South America between the tropics. South of the Tropic
of Cancer the number of species met with falls off very considerably, so
that in the Argentine Republic only fourteen members of the family
have as yet been recognized. This number will, however, be probably
increased when the less-known wooded districts of northern and eastern
Argentina have been more fully explored.</p>

<p>The fourteen species of Argentine Tanagers belong to ten different
genera, mostly of wide distribution. But to this rule one genus (<i>Stephanophorus</i>)
is an exception, being only found in Southern Brazil,
Paraguay, Uruguay, and Northern La Plata.</p>

in spring in the woods bordering on the Plata river, and is usually seen
singly or in pairs. The nest is built in a tree ten or twelve feet from
the ground, and is somewhat shallow and lined with soft dry grass.
The female lays four eggs, white and spotted with deep red. During
incubation the male sits concealed in the thick foliage close by, amusing
itself by the hour with singing, its performance consisting of chattering
disconnected notes uttered in so low a tone as to make one fancy that
the bird is merely trying to recall some melody it has forgotten, or
endeavouring to construct a new one by jerking out a variety of sounds
at random. The bird never gets beyond this unsatisfactory stage,
however, and must be admired for its exquisite beauty alone.</p>

neat construction. The eggs are two or three, greenish blue, slightly
spotted at the larger end with blackish and reddish zigzag markings.

<p>The extensive family of Finches, which has numerous representatives
in every part of the world, is well represented in the Argentine Republic.
Within the limits assigned to the present work forty-six species of his
group are already known to occur, and it is probable that this number
will be somewhat increased when the Argentine avifauna is thoroughly
worked out.</p>

<p>Most of the genera to which the Argentine Finches belong are forms
peculiar to the Neotropical Region, or at all events to the New World.
The genus <i>Chrysomitris</i>, which contains our Siskin and other Old-World
species, is the only one which has a wider distribution.</p>

<p>One of the most characteristic forms of Argentine Fringillid&aelig; is
<i>Poospiza</i>, of which seven species are met with within the limits of the

<p>This is a rare Finch, and its massive beak and rich blue plumage
give to it a highly interesting appearance; but about its habits I have
little to tell, for it is essentially a bird of the wild forest, seldom coming
near the abodes of man, and being, moreover, shy in disposition, it is
difficult to observe it even in its haunts. It is migratory, and is usually
seen singly or in pairs, or in small companies of four or five individuals.
The male sings, but his performance is merely a confused medley of
chattering notes, uttered in so low a tone that they can scarcely be
heard at a distance of twelve yards.</p>

occasionally pausing on the top of some tall grass to pour out their
delightful song. In character this resembles that of the Black-headed
Goldfinch; but has, Mr. Barrows says, a variety and sweetness far
beyond the powers of that bird.</p>

<p>It is just possible that Mr. Barrows&rsquo;s Finch may be Azara&rsquo;s unidentified
<i>Chipiu pardo y canela</i> (Apuntamientos, vol. i. no. 143), which

<p>This species is a summer visitor in Buenos Ayres, and is one of the last
to arrive and first to depart of our migrants. These birds are always
most abundant in plantations, preferring peach-trees, but do not associate
in flocks: they are exceedingly swift and active, overflowing with
life and energy, their impetuous notes and motions giving one the idea
that they are always in a state of violent excitement. The male has a
loud, startled chirp, also a song composed of eight or ten notes, delivered
with such vehemence and rapidity, that they run into each
other and sound more like a scream than a song. There is not a more
clever architect than this species; and while many <i>Synallaxes</i> are
laboriously endeavouring to show how stately a mansion of sticks a
little bird can erect for itself, the Screaming Finch has successfully solved
the problem of how to construct the most perfect nest for lightness,
strength, and symmetry with the fewest materials. It is a small, cup-shaped
structure, suspended hammock-wise between two slender upright
branches, and to which it is securely attached by fine hairs and webs.
It is made of thin, pale-coloured, fibrous roots, ingeniously woven
together&mdash;reddish or light-coloured horse-hair being sometimes substituted;
and so little material is used that, standing under the tree, a
person can easily count the eggs through the bottom of the nest. Its
apparent frailness is, however, its best protection from the prying eyes
of birds and mammals that prey on the eggs and young of small birds;
for it is difficult to detect this slight structure, through which the sunshine
and rain pass so freely. So light is the little basket-nest that
it may be placed on the open hand and blown away with the breath like
a straw; yet so strong that a man can suspend his weight from it<a class="pagenum" name="Page_47" id="Page_47">-&nbsp;47&nbsp;-</a>
without pulling it to pieces. The eggs are three in number, white and
spotted with black, sometimes bluish-brown spots are mingled with
the black.</p>

<p>This well-known species is perhaps the finest Finch the Argentines
have. The entire upper plumage is clear grey, the under surface pure
white; but its chief glory is its crest, which, with the anterior part of
the head and the throat, is of the most vivid scarlet. The song has little
variety, but is remarkably loud, and has that cheerful ring which most
people admire in their caged pets, possibly because it produces the idea
in the listener&rsquo;s mind that the songster is glad to be a prisoner. As a
cage-bird this Finch enjoys an extraordinary popularity; and a stranger
in Buenos Ayres, seeing the numbers that are exposed for sale by the
bird-dealers in the markets of that city, might fancy that a Cardinal in
a cage is considered a necessary part of the <i>m&eacute;nage</i> of every house
in the country. This large supply of caged birds comes from South
Brazil, Paraguay, and the north-eastern part of the Argentine country,
where the Cardinals are most abundant and unite in large flocks.
Probably they are not snared, but taken when young from the nest, as
most of the birds exposed for sale are in immature plumage.</p>

<p>The Cardinal in a wild state is found as far south as the province of
Buenos Ayres, but it is there a scarce bird. It breeds, Mr. Gibson
writes, at the end of October, and makes a shallow nest of twigs, vine-tendrils,
and horse-hair. The eggs are four; ground-colour white or
tinged with faint brown or greenish, and spotted with brown, more
densely at the large end.</p>

<p>This sweet-voiced little songster appears in Buenos Ayres at the end
of September; it is a common bird in grounds abounding in bushes
and scattered trees, and, in its bright ruddy breast and dark upper
plumage, has some resemblance to the English Robin; only it has a very<a class="pagenum" name="Page_50" id="Page_50">-&nbsp;50&nbsp;-</a>
conspicuous straw-coloured line above the eye. Its voice also, in purity
and sweetness of tone, is not unlike that of the Robin; but the song,
composed of six unvarying notes, is uttered in a deliberate, business-like
manner at regular intervals, and is monotonous. Never more than
two birds are seen together; they feed on the ground in humid situations,
the male frequently seeking a perch to sing. The nest is made
on the round, or in a close bush near the surface; the eggs have a pale
bluish ground-colour, irregularly marked with black and very dark
brown spots, and in some instances clouded with faint grey.</p>

<p>This Finch is common on the western slopes of the Andes as far
north as Peru; it is also found in the Mendoza district and throughout
Patagonia. It is very abundant on the Rio Negro, especially in the
immediate neighbourhood of the Carmen settlements, for, like the Chingolo
and other fringilline species, it is beneficially affected by cultivation.
Though not possessing any bright tints, it is a very charming bird,
tuneful, elegant in form, graceful and buoyant in its motions. When
approached it utters a series of low ticking sounds, and at intervals a
peculiar long squealing note. The song of the male is very agreeable,
and curiously resembles that of the Cachila Pipit (<i>Anthus correndera</i>).
It usually sits on a twig near the ground, and at intervals soars up to a
height of ten or twenty yards, and utters its song while gliding slowly
downwards with depressed wings and outspread tail. It sings throughout
the year; in bright weather its notes are heard all day long, but on
cold, cloudy, or wet days only after sunset. In the warm season they
live in pairs, and in the autumn unite in flocks of as many as two or
three hundred individuals, and have a strong undulating flight.</p>

<p>This pretty little grey-and-white Finch is common on the Chilian
side of the Andes and throughout Patagonia, and also occurs in the
Mendoza district. It is a tuneful bird, lively, social, and frolicsome
in disposition; in autumn and winter uniting in flocks of from fifty to
three or four hundred individuals; swift of flight, and when on the
wing fond of pursuing its fellows and engaging in mock battles. The
song of the male is very pleasing, the voice having more depth and
mellowness than is usual with the smaller fringilline singers, which, as
a rule, have thin, reedy, and tremulous notes. In summer it begins
singing very early, even before the faintest indication of coming daylight
is visible, and at that dark silent hour the notes may be heard at
a great distance and sound wonderfully sweet and impressive. During
the cold season, when they live in companies, the singing-time is in the
evening, when the birds are gathered in some thick-foliaged tree or
bush which they have chosen for a winter roosting-place. This winter-evening
song is a hurried twittering, and utterly unlike the serene note
of the male bird heard on summer mornings. A little while after sunset
the flock bursts into a concert, which lasts several minutes, sinking and
growing louder by turns, and during which it is scarcely possible to
distinguish the notes of individuals. Then follows an interval of silence,
after which the singing is again renewed very suddenly and as suddenly
ended. For an hour after sunset, and when all other late singers, like the
<i>Mimus</i>, have long been silent, this fitful impetuous singing is continued.
Close by a house on the Rio Negro, in which I spent several months,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_57" id="Page_57">-&nbsp;57&nbsp;-</a>
there were three very large cha&ntilde;ar bushes, where a multitude of Diuca
Finches used to roost, and they never missed singing in the evening,
however cold or rainy the weather happened to be. So fond were they
of this charming habit, that when I approached the bushes or stood
directly under them, the alarm caused by my presence would interrupt
the performance only for a few moments, and presently they would
burst into song again, the birds all the time swiftly pursuing each other
amongst the foliage, often within a foot of my head.</p>

oval, pale dirty green, thickly blotched with pale dull brown, becoming

<p><i>Hab.</i> Central and South America.</p>

<p>The common, familiar, favourite Sparrow over a large portion of the
South-American continent is the &ldquo;<i>Chingolo</i>.&rdquo; Darwin says that &ldquo;it
prefers inhabited places, but has not attained the air of domestication
of the English Sparrow, which bird in habits and general appearance it
resembles.&rdquo; As it breeds in the fields on the ground, it can never be
equally familiar with man, but in appearance it is like a refined copy of
the burly English Sparrow&mdash;more delicately tinted, the throat being
chestnut instead of black; the head smaller and better proportioned,
and with the added distinction of a crest, which it lowers and elevates
at all angles to express the various feelings affecting its busy little mind.</p>

<p>On the treeless desert pampas the Chingolo is rarely seen, but
wherever man builds a house and plants a tree there it comes to keep
him company, while in cultivated and thickly settled districts it is
excessively abundant, and about Buenos Ayres it literally swarms in
the fields and plantations. They are not, strictly speaking, gregarious,
but where food attracts them, or the shelter of a hedge on a cold windy
day, thousands are frequently seen congregated in one place; when
disturbed, however, these accidental flocks immediately break up, the
birds scattering abroad in different directions.</p>

<p>The Chingolo is a very constant singer, his song beginning with the
dawn of day in spring, and continuing until evening; it is very short,
being composed of a chipping prelude and four long notes, three uttered
in a clear thin voice, the last a trill. This song is repeated at brief
intervals, as the bird sits motionless, perched on the disc of a thistle-flower,
the summit of a stalk, or other elevation; and where the Chingolos
are very abundant, the whole air, on a bright spring morning, is
alive with their delicate melody; only one must pause and listen before<a class="pagenum" name="Page_59" id="Page_59">-&nbsp;59&nbsp;-</a>
he is aware of it, otherwise it will escape him, owing to its thin ethereal
character, the multitudinous notes not mingling but floating away,
as it were, detached and scattered, mere gossamer webs of sound that
very faintly impress the sense. They also sing frequently at night, and
in that dark silent time their little melody sounds strangely sweet and
expressive. The song varies greatly in different districts; thus, in
Bahia Blanca it is without the long trill at the end, and in other
localities I have found it vary in other ways.</p>

<p>The Chingolos pair about the end of September, and at that time
their battles are frequent, as they are very pugnacious. The nest is
made under a thistle or tuft of grass, in a depression in the soil, so that
the top of the nest is on a level with the surface of the ground. The
nest is mostly made and lined with horse-hair, the eggs four or five,
pale blue, and thickly spotted with dull brown. Sometimes, though
very rarely, a nest is found in a bush or on a stump several feet above
the ground. Two broods are reared in the season, the first in October,
the second in February or March. I have known these birds to breed in
April and May, and these very late nests escape the infliction of parasitical
eggs. When the nest is approached or taken, the Chingolos
utter no sound, but sit in dumb anxiety, with tail expanded and drooping
wings.</p>

beak and eye are yellow. It is a common species in the northern portion
of the Argentine country, and appears now to be gradually extending
its range southwards. Many years ago I first noticed it on the
pampas north of Buenos Ayres; afterwards I found it in the immediate
neighbourhood of that city; then it began to spread over the plains to
the south, appearing every spring in greater numbers, but it is still far
from common. It has, I fancy, a limited migration, as I could never
find one in winter. It is solitary, and frequents open plains and fields;
lives on the ground, and never alights on a tree. The male has a
favourite perch, a tall weed or post, where he spends a great deal of his
time, repeating his song at intervals of half a minute; it is short and
pleasing, and has a slight resemblance to the song of the Yellow-Hammer,
but is more delicate and melodious. When approached, the
bird flies down and conceals itself in the grass.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> South Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>

<p>In this Finch the plumage is alike in both sexes. Above it is dusky
olive-green, beneath grey; the beak is of a fine bright red. In Argentina
this bird is most common in the littoral forests along the Plata,
but ranges as far south as the Rio Negro in Patagonia. It does not
migrate, nor associates in flocks; but the sexes are faithful, and the
male and female are invariably together, and appear to be very fond of
each other&rsquo;s society. They have a loud, sharp alarm chirp or cry,
which bursts from the bird with the startling suddenness of a sneeze
from a human being; also a confused unmelodious song, which always
reminds me, in its hurry, vehemence, and peculiar sound, of the
gobbling of a turkey-cock. They are not shy, but when approached sit
jerking their tails about, and uttering loud chirps as if greatly excited.
The flight is very curious; the bird springs up with great suddenness,
and with tail erect, and the long legs dangling down like a Rail&rsquo;s,
proceeds by a series of irregular jerks, violently shutting and opening
its wings. They breed on the ground under the grass, and conceal
their nest so well that I doubt whether the parasitical <i>Molothrus</i> ever
finds it. I have, at all events, never seen them followed by the young
of <i>Molothrus</i> demanding food.</p>

<p>As a rule, small seed-eating birds are beneficially affected by the
presence of man; thus our common <i>Zonotrichia</i> and other sparrows
and finches have become excessively numerous in the most thickly-settled
districts. With the Red-billed Finch, however, just the contrary
has happened; and since I have known this species it has disappeared
from many localities where it was once quite common. Azara&rsquo;s name
for this species, <i>Habia de ba&ntilde;ado</i>, signifies that it is a marsh bird; but
though now found chiefly in marshy situations, it was once common
enough over the entire pampas region, before the great plains were<a class="pagenum" name="Page_63" id="Page_63">-&nbsp;63&nbsp;-</a>
settled on by Europeans. The bird is very badly protected by nature
against raptorial species, owing to its very conspicuous red beak, its
habit of perching on the summit of tall plants and other elevated
positions, its loud impetuous voice, which invites attention, and the
weak eccentric flight, which challenges pursuit. It is essential to its
safety that it should have, in the open country it frequents, a dense
grass cover into which it can plunge on the slightest alarm. Where
cattle are introduced, the original pampas-grass, which afforded the
suitable conditions, disappears, giving place to the soft, perishable
grasses, clovers, and thistles of Europe. Where these changes take
place, the bird cannot escape from its enemies and quickly disappears;
while many Dendrocolaptine species inhabiting the same situations are
saved by their inconspicuous protective colouring, sharp wedge-like
bodies, and swift mouse-like motions on the ground. In marshy places
on the pampas, abounding with long aquatic grasses and reed-beds, the
Red-bill still maintains its existence, but from its old habitat on the
open grassy plains, where it was once the dominant Finch, it has utterly
vanished.</p>

<p>This beautiful little golden-plumaged Finch, the male distinguished
from his consort by a brighter yellow colour and a black head, is extremely
common throughout the entire length of the Argentine country<a class="pagenum" name="Page_65" id="Page_65">-&nbsp;65&nbsp;-</a>
from Brazil to Patagonia. In the Buenos-Ayrean district it probably
has a partial migration, as small flocks are seen to arrive in spring; but
further south, in Patagonia, it appears to be strictly resident. In
settled districts they are always more abundant than in the woods, and
they have a special predilection for poplar groves, and always prefer a
poplar to build in. They go in small flocks, seldom more than about a
dozen birds together, have a rapid, undulating flight, feed chiefly on the
ground like most Finches, and also frequently alight in the seeding-time
on plants like the lettuce and <i>Sonchus asper</i> (a common weed) and,
clinging to the stem, dexterously pick off the seed, scattering the down
about them in a little cloud. They are very tuneful, restless, quick in
their motions, apparently always in a light-hearted merry mood. Being
much admired for their song, they are often kept in cages; and certainly,
for cheerfulness and constancy in singing, they take the foremost
place amongst the Finches; but there is little expression in the song,
which is composed of a variety of short twittering notes, uttered with
great rapidity, as the bird sits perched on a twig or undulates from tree
to tree. Usually the notes flow in a continuous stream, but occasionally
the bird sings in a different manner, making a pause of two or three
seconds of silence after every eight or ten short notes. When the female
is on the nest the male sometimes perches near her amongst the leaves
and sings <i>sotto voce</i>, apparently for her pleasure only, the notes being
so low that, at a distance of ten yards, they can scarcely be heard.</p>

<p>The nest is usually placed between the angle formed by a small
branch and the bole of the tree, and is a deep, well-made structure
composed of many materials, and lined with horsehair, down, or
feathers. The eggs are five, very small for the bird, pure white, and so
frail that it is not easy to take them from the nest without breaking
them.</p>

<p>While engaged in building, the birds constantly utter a low, soft,
trilling note; and when the nest is approached they break out into long,
somewhat reedy notes, resembling those of the Canary, expressive of
alarm or curiosity.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Hab.</i> S. Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>

<p>The Yellow &ldquo;House-Sparrow,&rdquo; as this species is called, is the town-bird
of Buenos Ayres, but does not multiply greatly, nor is he familiar
with man, like his rough, sooty-plumaged, far-away London relation.</p>

<p>The forehead of the male is bright orange, the prevailing colour of
the entire plumage yellow, clouded with other hues. The female is
grey, marked with pale fuscous, and is less in size than her mate.
They remain with us all the year and live in pairs, the sexes in this
species being faithful. Sometimes they are seen associating in small
flocks, but I am inclined to believe that only the young unmated birds
are gregarious. In 1867-8, during the cholera epidemic in Buenos
Ayres, the Sparrows all disappeared from the town, and I was told by
the manager of a large steam flour-mill in the town that the birds had
not gone away, but had died. They were found dead all about the mill
where they had been very abundant. My informant was a careful
observer, and I have no doubt that he was correct in what he told me.</p>

<p>In spring and summer the male sings frequently with great energy,
but without much melody. After a hurried prelude of sharp chirps and
trills, he pours out a continuous stream of sound, composed of innumerable
brief notes, high and shrill as those of a bat, wounding the ear
with their excessive sharpness, and emitted so rapidly that the whole
song is more like that of a cicada than of a bird. This piercing torrent
of sound is broken at intervals by a long grave note, or half a dozen
short rapid notes in a lower key, which come as an agreeable relief.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_67" id="Page_67">-&nbsp;67&nbsp;-</a>In
towns they build in walls, like the English Sparrow; in country
places they always select the domed nest of some Dendrocolaptine species
to breed in. Possibly in some districts where I have not been, this
Sparrow selects other breeding-sites; my experience is that outside of
a town it never lays anywhere but in some domed nest, and at home I
frequently put up boxes for them in the trees, but they would not
notice them, though the Wrens and Swallows were glad to have them.
Sometimes they make choice of the large fabric of the <i>Anumbius acuticaudatus</i>,
called Le&ntilde;atero in the vernacular; but their claim to this
nest (even when the Le&ntilde;ateros are out of it) is frequently disputed by
other species which possess the same habit as this Sparrow, but are
more powerful than he. Their favourite breeding-place is, however, the
solid earthen structure of the Oven-bird; and it is wonderful to see
how persistently and systematically they labour to drive out the lawful
owners&mdash;birds so much larger and more powerful than themselves.
Early in spring, and before the advent of the Tree-Martins, the pair of
Sparrows begin haunting the neighbourhood of the oven they have
elected to take possession of, usually one pretty high up in a tree. As
the season advances their desire towards it increases, and they take up
their position on the very tree it is in; and finally a particular branch
near the oven, commanding a good view of the entrance, is chosen for
a permanent resting-place. Here they spend a great portion of their
time in song, twitterings, and loving dalliance, and, if attentively observed,
they are seen with eyes ever fixed on the coveted abode. As
the need for a receptacle for the eggs becomes more urgent they grow
bolder, and in the absence of the owners flit about the oven, alight on
it, and even enter it. The Oven-bird appears to drive them off with
screams of indignation, but the moment he retires they are about it
again, and, even when it contains eggs or young birds, begin impudently
carrying in feathers, straws, and other materials for a nest, as if they
were already in undisputed possession. At this stage the Tree-Martins
(<i>Progne tapera</i>) perhaps appear to complicate matters; and even if these
last comers do not succeed in ousting the Oven-birds, they are sure to
seize the oven when it becomes vacant, and the Sparrows, in spite of their
earlier claim, are left out in the cold. But they do not take their defeat
quietly, or, rather, they do not know when they are beaten, but still
remain to harrass their fellow-pirates, just as they did the Oven-birds
before, bringing straws and feathers in their beaks, and when forced to
drop these materials and chased from the neighbourhood with great noise
and fury by the Tree-Martins, it is only to return undaunted in a few
minutes, bringing more straws and feathers.</p>

<p>This Sparrow makes a rather large nest, neatly lined with horsehair,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_68" id="Page_68">-&nbsp;68&nbsp;-</a>
and lays five eggs, long, pointed, the entire surface thickly marked with
deep chocolate-brown.</p>

<p>In rural districts this species is comparatively rare, not more than one
or two couples being seen about each habitation; and I scarcely think
it would be too much to say that there are four or five thousand
Chingolos for every individual Yellow Sparrow. Yet it is a hardy little
bird, well able to hold its own, subsists on the same kind of food and
lays as many eggs as the <i>Zonotrichia</i>; and it possesses, moreover, a
great advantage over the dominant species in placing its nest out of the
reach of the parasitical <i>Molothrus</i>, the destroyer of about fifty per cent.
of the Chingolo&rsquo;s eggs. I can only attribute the great disparity in the
numbers of the two species to the fact that the Yellow House-Sparrow
will breed only (out of towns) in nests not easily taken, and to the
stubborn pertinacity which leads it to waste the season in these vain
efforts, while the other species is rearing its brood. This is a blunder
of instinct comparable to that of the Minera (<i>Geositta cunicularia</i>),
mentioned by Darwin in the &lsquo;Voyage of a Naturalist,&rsquo; where the bird
made its hole in a mud wall a few inches wide, and on coming out on
the other side simply went back and made another hole, and then
another, unable to understand that the wall had not the requisite width.</p>

<p>In such a case as the Yellow House-Sparrow presents, in which the
colour of the sexes differs, the female being without any of the brighter
hues found in the male, and which makes an elaborate nest and lays
deeply-coloured eggs, it is impossible not to believe that the bird
originally built in exposed situations, and subsequently&mdash;perhaps in
very recent times&mdash;acquired the habit of breeding in dark holes. The
frequent destruction of the exposed nest, and an abundance of vacant
domed nests, into which some individuals occasionally penetrated to
breed, would lead to the acquisition of such a nesting-habit; for the
birds inheriting it would have an advantage and be preserved, while
those persisting in the old habit of building exposed nests would perish.
Domed nests made by Dendrocolaptine birds are very abundant even
now, and it is probable that, before the country became settled by
Europeans, they were very much more numerous. Darwin, speaking
of the Oven-bird&rsquo;s habit of always placing its oven in the most conspicuous
and (to man) accessible places, predicts, and truly I believe,
that this habit will eventually cause the extinction of the species; for
when the country becomes more thickly settled, the bird-nesting boys
will destroy all the ovens. Probably when the Oven-birds were more
abundant the Sparrows could always find vacant ovens to breed in,
until a habit of breeding almost exclusively in these safe and convenient
bird-built houses was acquired; and the present seemingly stupid<a class="pagenum" name="Page_69" id="Page_69">-&nbsp;69&nbsp;-</a>
persistence of the birds in struggling to get possession of those already
occupied by stronger species, only shows that the habit or instinct has
not been modified to suit a change in the conditions&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> a diminishing
number of ovens to breed in, with, perhaps, the increase of other
stronger species possessing the same habit. But while the instinct
thus survives too strongly in the country birds, many individuals have
taken to a town life, and acquired the new habit of breeding in holes in
brick walls. Probably this race of town birds will eventually colonize
the rural districts, and usurp the place of the country birds, which will
then be placed at a disadvantage.</p>

whole upper plumage yellowish olive, with dun markings, the lower
surface of a dull yellow. The female is a little smaller than the male,
and her colours are somewhat dimmer.</p>

<p>This species is resident and gregarious in the Argentine Republic, and
in autumn frequently congregates in flocks of several thousands. They
are not so universally distributed as the Chingolo, and are not wood-birds,
but frequent open plains abounding in thistles and other coarse
herbage, which affords them shelter. In cultivated districts, where
their food is most abundant, they are excessively numerous, and, after
the harvest has been gathered, frequent the fields in immense flocks.
While feeding, the flocks scatter over a large area of ground, being
broken up into small companies of a dozen or more birds, and at such
times are so intent on their food that a person can walk about amongst
them without disturbing them. They take flight very suddenly, bursting
into a thousand chirping, scolding notes, pursue each other through
the air, and, after wheeling about the field for a minute or two, suddenly
drop down into the grass again and are silent as before.</p>

<p>In August they begin to sing, here and there an individual being
heard in the fields; but when the weather grows warmer they repair
to the plantations in vast numbers, and, sitting on the branches, sing
in a concert of innumerable voices, which produces a great volume of
confused sound, and which often continues for hours at a time without
intermission.</p>

<p>By-and-by these pleasant choirs break up, the birds all scattering
over the plains and fields to woo and build, and it is then first discovered
that the male has a peculiar and very sweet song. Apart from
his fellows, he acquires a different manner of singing, soaring up from
his stand on the summit of a bush or stalk, and beginning his song the
moment he quits his perch. Ascending, he utters a series of long,
melodious notes, not loud, but very distinctly enunciated and increasing
in volume; at a height of fifty or sixty yards he pauses, the notes becoming
slower; then, as he descends with a graceful spiral flight, the wings
outstretched and motionless, the notes also fall, becoming lower,
sweeter, and more impressive till he reaches the earth. After alighting
the song continues, the notes growing longer, thinner, and clearer,
until they dwindle to the merest threads of sound, and cease to be
audible except to a person standing within a few yards of the songster.
The song is quite unique in character, and its great charm is in its
gradual progress from the somewhat thick notes at the commencement
to the thin, tremulous tones with which the bird returns to earth, and
which change again to the excessively attenuated sounds at the end.</p>

<p>The nest is deep, well-built, and well-concealed, sometimes resting on<a class="pagenum" name="Page_71" id="Page_71">-&nbsp;71&nbsp;-</a>
the ground, but frequently raised above it. It contains five long,
pointed eggs, with a white or bluish-white ground-colour, and thickly
spotted with brown. I have, frequently found the eggs of the <i>Molothrus</i>
in its nest, but have never been able to see this Sparrow feeding, or
followed by, a young <i>Molothrus</i>. Possibly, if it ever hatches the parasitical
egg at all, the voracious young Cow-bird is starved by the
delicate food supplied by its foster-parents.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia, and Brazil.</p>

<p>This species is the <i>Tordo Comun</i> of Azara, and is usually called
&ldquo;<i>Tordo</i>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<i>Pajaro Negro</i>&rdquo; by the Spanish, and &ldquo;<i>Blackbird</i>&rdquo; by the
English-speaking Argentines. A more suitable name, I think, is the
Argentine Cow-bird, which has been given to it by some writers on
ornithology, Cow-bird being the name of the closely allied North-American
species, <i>Molothrus pecoris</i>.</p>

<p>This Cow-bird is widely distributed in South America, and is
common throughout the Argentine country, including Patagonia, as
far south as Chupat. In Buenos Ayres it is very numerous, especially
in cultivated districts where there are plantations of trees. The male
is clothed in a glossy plumage of deep violaceous purple, the wings and
tail being dark metallic green; but seen at a distance or in the shade
the bird looks black. The female is inferior in size and has a dull,
mouse-coloured plumage, and black beak and legs. The males are
much more numerous than the females. Azara says that nine birds in
ten are males; but I am not sure that the disparity is so great as that.
It seems strange and contrary to Nature&rsquo;s usual rule that the smaller,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_73" id="Page_73">-&nbsp;73&nbsp;-</a>
shyer, inconspicuous individuals should be in such a minority; but the
reason is perhaps that the <i>male eggs</i> of the Cow-bird are harder-shelled
than the <i>female eggs</i>, and escape destruction oftener, when the parent
bird exercises its disorderly and destructive habit of pecking holes in
all the eggs it finds in the nests into which it intrudes.</p>

<p>The Cow-birds are sociable to a greater degree than most species,
their companies not breaking up during the laying-season; for, as
they are parasitical, the female merely steals away to drop her egg in
any nest she can find, after which she returns to the flock. They
feed on the ground, where in their movements and in the habit
the male has of craning out its neck when disturbed, they resemble
Starlings. The male has also a curious habit of carrying his tail raised
vertically while feeding. They follow the domestic cattle about the
pastures, and frequently a dozen or more birds may be seen perched
along the back of a cow or horse. When the animal is grazing they
group themselves close to its mouth, like chickens round a hen when
she scratches up the ground, eager to snatch up the small insects
exposed where the grass is cropped close. In spring they also follow
the plough to pick up worms and grubs.</p>

<p>The song of the male, particularly when making love, is accompanied
with gestures and actions somewhat like those of the domestic Pigeon.
He swells himself out, beating the ground with his wings, and uttering
a series of deep internal notes, followed by others loud and clear; and
occasionally, when uttering them, he suddenly takes wing and flies
directly away from the female to a distance of fifty yards, and performs
a wide circuit about her in the air, singing all the time. The homely
object of his short-lived passion always appears utterly indifferent to
this curious and pretty performance; yet she must be even more
impressionable than most female birds, since she continues scattering
about her parasitical and often wasted eggs during four months in
every year. Her language consists of a long note with a spluttering
sound, to express alarm or curiosity, and she occasionally chatters in a
low tone as if trying to sing. In the evening, when the birds congregate
on the trees to roost they often continue singing in concert until
it is quite dark; and when disturbed at night the males frequently
utter their song while taking flight, reminding one of the <i>Icterus
pyrrhopterus</i>, which has only its usual melody to express fear and other
painful emotions. On rainy days, when they are driven to the shelter
of trees, they will often sing together for hours without intermission,
the blending of innumerable voices producing a rushing sound as of
a high wind. At the end of summer they congregate in flocks of tens
of thousands, so that the ground where they are feeding seems carpeted<a class="pagenum" name="Page_74" id="Page_74">-&nbsp;74&nbsp;-</a>
with black, and the trees when they alight appear to have a black
foliage. At such times one wonders that many small species on which
they are parasites do not become extinct by means of their pernicious
habit. In Buenos Ayres, where they are most numerous, they have
a migration, which is only partial, however. It is noticeable chiefly in
the autumn, and varies greatly in different years. In some seasons it
is very marked, when for many days in February and March the birds
are seen travelling northwards, flock succeeding flock all day long,
passing by with a swift low undulating flight, their wings producing a
soft musical sound; and this humming flight of the migrating Cow-birds
is as familiar to every one acquainted with nature in Buenos
Ayres as the whistling of the wind or the distant lowing of cattle.</p>

<p>The procreant instinct of this <i>Molothrus</i> has always seemed so
important to me, for many reasons, that I have paid a great deal of
attention to it; and the facts, or, at all events, the most salient of them,
which I have collected during several years of observation, I propose
to append here, classified under different headings so as to avoid
confusion and to make it easy for other observers to see at a glance
just how much I have learnt.</p>

<p>Though I have been familiar with this species from childhood, when
I used to hunt every day for their wasted eggs on the broad, clean
walks of the plantation, and removed them in pity from the nests of
little birds where I found them, I have never ceased to wonder at their
strange instinct, which in its wasteful destructive character, so unlike
the parasitical habit in other species, seems to strike a discordant note
in the midst of the general harmony of nature.</p>
<br />

<h6><i>Mistakes and Imperfections of the Procreant Instinct of</i> Molothrus
bonariensis.</h6>

<p>1. The Cow-birds, as we have seen, frequently waste their eggs by
dropping them on the ground.</p>

<p>2. They also occasionally lay in old forsaken nests. This I have
often observed, and to make very sure I took several old nests and
placed them in trees and bushes, and found that eggs were laid
in them.</p>

<p>3. They also frequently lay in nests where incubation has actually
begun. When this happens the Cow-bird&rsquo;s egg is lost if incubation
is far advanced; but if the eggs have been sat on three or four days
only, then it has a good chance of being hatched and the young bird
reared along with its foster-brothers.</p>

<p>4. One female often lays several eggs in the same nest, instead of
laying only one, as does, according to Wilson, the <i>Molothrus pecoris</i><a class="pagenum" name="Page_75" id="Page_75">-&nbsp;75&nbsp;-</a>
of North America. I conclude that this is so from the fact that in
cases where the eggs of a species vary considerably in form, size, and
markings, each individual of the species lays eggs precisely or nearly
alike. So when I find two, three, or four eggs of the Cow-bird in
one nest all alike in colour and other particulars, and yet in half a
hundred eggs from other nests cannot find one to match with them, it
is impossible not to believe that the eggs found together, and possessing
a family likeness, were laid by the same bird.</p>

<p>5. Several females often lay in one nest, so that the number of eggs
in it frequently makes incubation impossible. One December I
collected ten nests of the Scissor-tail (<i>Milvulus tyrannus</i>) from my
trees; they contained a total of 47 eggs, 12 of the Scissor-tails and
35 of the Cow-birds. It is worthy of remark that the <i>Milvulus</i> breeds
in October or early in November, rearing only one brood; so that
these ten nests found late in December were of birds that had lost
their first nests. Probably three fourths of the lost nests of <i>Milvulus</i>
are abandoned in consequence of the confusion caused in them by the
Cow-birds.</p>

<p>6. The Cow-birds, male and female, destroy many of the eggs in the
nests they visit, by pecking holes in the shells, breaking, devouring, and
stealing them. This is the most destructive habit of the bird, and is
probably possessed by individuals in different degrees. I have often
carefully examined all the parasitical eggs in a nest, and after three or
four days found that these eggs had disappeared, others, newly laid,
being in their places. I have seen the female Cow-bird strike her
beak into an egg and fly away with it; and I have often watched the
male bird perched close by while the female was on the nest, and
when she quitted it seen him drop down and begin pecking holes in the
eggs. In some nests found full of parasitical eggs every egg has holes
pecked in the shell, for the bird destroys indiscriminately eggs of its
own and of other species.</p>
<br />

<h6><i>Advantages possessed by</i> M. bonariensis <i>over its dupes.</i></h6>

<p>After reading the preceding notes one might ask, If there is so much
that is defective and irregular in the reproductive instinct of <i>M. bonariensis</i>,
how does the species maintain its existence, and even increase
to such an amazing extent? for it certainly is very much more numerous,
over an equal area, than other parasitical species. For its greater
abundance there may be many reasons unknown to us. The rarer
species may be less hardy, have more enemies, be exposed to more
perils in their long migrations, &amp;c. That it is able to maintain its
existence in spite of irregularities in its instinct is no doubt due to
the fact that its eggs and young possess many advantages over the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_76" id="Page_76">-&nbsp;76&nbsp;-</a>
eggs and young of the species upon which it is parasitical. Some of
these advantages are due to those very habits of the parent bird which
at first sight appear most defective; others to the character of the
egg and embryo, time of evolution, &amp;c.</p>

<p>1. The egg of the Cow-bird is usually larger, and almost invariably
harder-shelled than are the eggs it is placed with; those of the Yellow-breast
(<i>Pseudoleistes virescens</i>) being the one exception I am acquainted
with. The harder shell of its own egg, considered in relation to the
destructive egg-breaking habit of the bird, gives it the best chance of
being preserved; for though the Cow-bird never distinguishes its own
eggs, of which indeed it destroys a great many, a larger proportion
escape in a nest where many eggs are indiscriminately broken.</p>

<p>2. The vitality or tenacity of life appears greater in the embryo
Cow-bird than in other species; this circumstance also, in relation to
the egg-breaking habit and to the habit of laying many eggs in a
nest, gives it a further advantage. I have examined nests of the
Scissor-tail, containing many eggs, after incubation had begun, and
have been surprised at finding those of the Scissor-tail addled, even
when placed most advantageously in the nest for receiving heat from
the parent bird, while those of the Cow-bird contained living embryos,
even when under all the other eggs, and, as frequently happens, glued
immovably to the nest by the matter from broken eggs spilt over them.</p>

<p>The following instance of extraordinary vitality in an embryo <i>Molothrus</i>
seems to show incidentally that in some species protective habits,
which will act as a check on the parasitical instinct, may be in the
course of formation.</p>

<p>Though birds do not, as a rule, seem able to distinguish parasitical
eggs from their own, however different in size and colour they may
be, they often do seem to know that eggs dropped in their nest before
they themselves have began to lay ought not to be there; and the
nest, even after its completion, is not infrequently abandoned on
account of these premature eggs. Some species, however, do not forsake
their nests; and though they do not throw the parasitical eggs
out, which would seem the simplest plan, they have discovered how to
get rid of them and so save themselves the labour of making a fresh
nest. Their method is to add a new deep lining, under which the
strange eggs are buried out of sight and give no more trouble. The
<i>Sisopygis icterophrys</i>&mdash;a common Tyrant-bird in Buenos Ayres&mdash;frequently
has recourse to this expedient; and the nest it makes being
rather shallow the layer of fresh material, under which the strange eggs
are buried, is built upwards above the rim of the original nest; so
that this supplementary nest is like one saucer placed within another,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_77" id="Page_77">-&nbsp;77&nbsp;-</a>
and the observer is generally able to tell from the thickness of the
whole structure whether any parasitical eggs have been entombed in
it or not. Finding a very thick nest one day, containing two half-fledged
young birds besides three addled eggs, I opened it, removing
the upper portion, or additional nest, intact, and discovered beneath it
three buried <i>Molothrus</i> eggs, their shells encrusted with dirt and glued
together with broken egg-matter spilt over them. In trying to get
them out without pulling the nest to pieces I broke them all; two
were quite rotten, but the third contained a living embryo, ready
to be hatched, and very lively and hungry when I took it in my
hand. The young Tyrant-birds were about a fortnight old, and as they
hatch out only about twenty days after the parent-bird begins laying,
this parasitical egg with a living chick in it must have been deeply
buried in the nest for five or six weeks. Probably after the young
Tyrant-birds came out of their shells and began to grow, the little heat
from their bodies penetrating to the buried egg, served to bring the
embryo in it to maturity; but when I saw it I felt (like a person who
sees a ghost) strongly inclined to doubt the evidence of my own senses.</p>

<p>3. The comparatively short time the embryo takes to hatch gives it
another and a great advantage; for, whereas the eggs of other small
birds require from fourteen to sixteen days to mature, that of the Cow-bird
hatches in eleven days and a half from the moment incubation
commences; so that when the female Cow-bird makes so great a mistake
as to drop an egg with others that have already been sat on, unless
incubation be very far advanced, it still has a chance of being hatched
before or contemporaneously with the others; but even if the others
hatch first, the extreme hardiness of the embryo serves to keep it alive
with the modicum of heat it receives.</p>

<p>4. Whenever the <i>Molothrus</i> is hatched together with the young of its
foster-parents, if these are smaller than the parasite, as usually is the
case, soon after exclusion from the shell they disappear, and the young
Cow-bird remains sole occupant of the nest. How it succeeds in
expelling or destroying them, if it indeed does destroy them, I have not
been able too learn.</p>

<p>5. To all these circumstances favourable to the <i>Molothrus</i> may be
added another of equal or even greater importance. It is never engaged
with the dilatory and exhaustive process of rearing its own young; and
for this reason continues in better condition than other species, and,
moreover, being gregarious and practising promiscuous sexual intercourse,
must lay a much greater number of eggs than other species.
In our domestic fowls we see that hens that never become broody lay a
great deal more than others. Some of our small birds rear two, others<a class="pagenum" name="Page_78" id="Page_78">-&nbsp;78&nbsp;-</a>
only one brood in the season&mdash;building, incubation, and tending the
young taking up much time, so that they are usually from two to
three months and a half employed. But the Cow-bird is like the fowl
that never incubates, and continues dropping eggs during four months
and a half. From the beginning of September until the end of January
the males are seen incessantly wooing the females, and during most of
this time eggs are found. I find that small birds will, if deprived
repeatedly of their nests, lay and even hatch four times in the season,
thus laying, if the full complement be four, sixteen eggs. No doubt
the Cow-bird lays a much larger number than that; my belief is that
every female lays from sixty to a hundred eggs every season, though I
have nothing but the extraordinary number of wasted eggs one finds to
judge from.</p>

<p>Before dismissing the subject of the advantages the <i>Molothrus</i> possesses
over its dupes, and of the real or apparent defects of its instinct,
some attention should be given to another circumstance, viz., the new
conditions introduced by land-cultivation and their effect on the species.
The altered conditions have, in various ways, served to remove many
extraneous checks on the parasitical instinct, and the more the birds
multiply, the more irregular and disordered does the instinct necessarily
become. In wild districts where it was formed, and where birds building
accessible nests are proportionately fewer, the instinct seems different
from what it does in cultivated districts. Parasitical eggs are not
common in the desert, and even the most exposed nests there are probably
never overburdened with them. But in cultivated places, where
their food abounds, the birds congregate in the orchards and plantations
in great numbers, and avail themselves of all the nests, ill-concealed as
they must always be in the clean, open-foliaged trees planted by man.</p>
<br />

<h6><i>Diversity in Colour of Eggs.</i></h6>

<p>There is an extraordinary diversity in the colour, form, and disposition
of markings &amp;c. of the eggs of <i>M. bonariensis</i>; and I doubt
whether any other species exists laying eggs so varied. About half the
eggs one finds, or nearly half, are pure unspotted white, like the eggs
of birds that breed in dark holes. Others are sparsely sprinkled with
such exceedingly minute specks of pale pink or grey, as to appear quite
spotless until closely examined. After the pure white, the most common
variety is an egg with a white ground, densely and uniformly spotted
or blotched with red. Another not uncommon variety has a very pale,
flesh-coloured ground, uniformly marked with fine characters, that look
as if inscribed on the shell with a pen. A much rarer variety has a
pure white shell with a few large or variously sized chocolate spots.<a class="pagenum" name="Page_79" id="Page_79">-&nbsp;79&nbsp;-</a>
Perhaps the rarest variety is an egg entirely of a fine deep red; but
between this lovely marbled egg and the white one with almost imperceptible
specks, there are varieties without number; for there is no such
thing as characteristic markings in the eggs of this species, although,
as I have said before, the eggs of the same individual show a family
resemblance.</p>
<br />

<h6><i>Habits of the young</i> &nbsp;M. bonariensis.</h6>

<p>Small birds of all species, when first hatched, closely resemble each
other; after they are fledged the resemblance is less, but still comparatively
great; grey, interspersed with brown, is the colour of most of
them, or at least of the upper exposed plumage. There is also a great
similarity in their cries of hunger and fear&mdash;shrill, querulous, prolonged,
and usually tremulous notes. It is not, then, to be wondered at that
the foster-parents of the young <i>Molothrus</i> so readily respond to its
cries, understanding the various expressions denoting hunger, fear, pain,
as well as when uttered by their own offspring. But the young <i>Molothrus</i>
never understands the language of its foster-parents as other
young birds understand the language of their real parents, rising to
receive food when summoned, and concealing themselves or trying to
escape when the warning note is given. How does the young <i>Molothrus</i>
learn to distinguish, even by sight, its foster-parent from any other bird
approaching the nest? It generally manifests no fear even at a large
object. On thrusting my fingers into any nest, I find young birds,
if still blind or but recently hatched, will hold up and open their mouths
expecting food; but in a very few days they learn to distinguish between
their parents and other objects approaching them, and to show
alarm even when not warned of danger. Consider the different
behaviour of three species that seldom or never warn their offspring of
danger. The young of <i>Synallaxis spixi</i>, though in a deep domed nest,
will throw itself to the ground, attempting thus to make its escape.
The young of <i>Mimus patagonicus</i> sits close and motionless, with closed
eyes, mimicking death. The young of our common <i>Zenaida</i>, even
before it is fledged, will swell itself up and strike angrily at the intruder
with beak and wings; and, by making so brave a show of its inefficient
weapons, it probably often saves itself from destruction. But any thing
approaching the young <i>Molothrus</i> is welcomed with fluttering wings and
clamorous cries, as if all creatures were expected to minister to its
necessities.</p>

<p>December 24.&mdash;To-day I found a young <i>Molothrus</i> in the nest of
<i>Spermophila c&aelig;rulescens</i>; he cried for food on seeing my hand approach
the nest; I took him out and dropped him down, when, finding himself<a class="pagenum" name="Page_80" id="Page_80">-&nbsp;80&nbsp;-</a>
on the ground, he immediately made off, half-flying. After a hard
chase I succeeded in recapturing him, and began to twirl him about,
making him scream, so as to inform his foster-parents of his situation,
for they were not by at the moment. I then put him back in, or rather
upon, the little cradle of a nest, and plucked half-a-dozen large measure-worms
from an adjacent twig. The worms I handed to the bird as I
drew them from the cases, and with great greediness he devoured them
all, notwithstanding the ill-treatment he had just received, and utterly
disregarding the wild excited cries of his foster-parents, just arrived
and hovering within three or four feet of the nest.</p>

<p>Last summer I noticed a young Cow-bird in a stubble-field, perched
on the top of a slender dry stalk; as it was clamouring at short
intervals, I waited to see what bird would come to it. It proved to be
the diminutive <i>Hapalocercus flaviventris</i>; and I was much amused to
see the little thing fly directly to its larger foster-offspring and, alighting
on its back, drop a worm into the upturned open mouth. After remaining
a moment on its singular perch, the Flycatcher flew away, but
in less than half a minute returned and perched again on the young
bird&rsquo;s back. I continued watching them until the <i>Molothrus</i> flew off,
but not before I had seen him fed seven or eight times in the same
manner.</p>

<p>In the foregoing anecdotes may be seen the peculiar habits of
the young <i>Molothrus</i>. As the nests in which it is hatched, from those
of the little <i>Serpophaga</i> and Wren to those of <i>Mimus</i>, vary so much in
size and materials, and are placed in such different situations, the young
<i>Molothrus</i> must have in most of them a somewhat incongruous appearance.
But in the habits of the young bird is the greatest incongruity
or inadaptation. When the nest is in a close thicket or forest, though
much too small for the bird, and although the bird itself cannot understand
its foster-parents, and welcomes all things that, whether with
good or evil design, come near it, the unfitness is not so apparent as
when the nest is in open fields and plains.</p>

<p>The young <i>Molothrus</i> differs from the true offspring of its foster-parents
in its habit of quitting the nest as soon as it is able, trying to
follow the old bird, and placing itself in the most conspicuous place it
can find, such as the summit of a stalk or weed, and there demanding
food with frequent and importunate cries. Thus the little Flycatcher
had acquired the habit of perching on the back of its charge to feed it,
because parent birds invariably perch above their young to feed them,
and the young Cow-bird prevented this by always sitting on the summit
of the stalk it perched on. The habit is most fatal on the open and
closely cropped pampas inhabited by the Cachila (<i>Anthus correndera</i>).<a class="pagenum" name="Page_81" id="Page_81">-&nbsp;81&nbsp;-</a>
In December, when the Cachila Pipit rears its second brood, the <i>Milvago
chimango</i> also has young, and feeds them almost exclusively on the
young of various species of small birds. At this season the Chimango
destroys great numbers of the young of the Cachila and of <i>Synallaxis
hudsoni</i>. Yet these birds are beautifully adapted in structure, coloration,
and habits to their station. It thus happens that in districts
where the <i>Molothrus</i> is abundant, their eggs are found in a majority of
the Cachilas&rsquo; nests: and yet to find a young Cow-bird out of the nest
is a rare thing here, for as soon as the young birds are able to quit the
nest and expose themselves they are all or nearly all carried off
by the Chimangos.</p>
<br />

<h6><i>Conjectures as to the Origin of the Parasitic Instinct in</i> M. bonariensis.</h6>

<p>Darwin&rsquo;s opinion that the &ldquo;immediate and final cause of the Cuckoo&rsquo;s
instinct is that she lays her eggs not daily, but at intervals of two or
three days&rdquo; (&lsquo;Origin of Species&rsquo;), carries no great appearance of probability
with it; for might it not just as reasonably be said that the
parasitic instinct is the immediate and final cause of her laying her eggs
at long intervals? If it is favourable to a species with the instinct of
the Cuckoo (and it probably is favourable) to lay eggs at longer
intervals than other species, then natural selection would avail itself of
every modification in the reproductive organs that tended to produce
such a result, and make the improved structure permanent. It is said
(&lsquo;Origin of Species,&rsquo; chapter vii.) that the American Cuckoo lays
also at long intervals, and has eggs and young at the same time in its
nest, a circumstance manifestly disadvantageous. Of the <i>Coccyzus
melanocoryphus</i>, the only one of our three <i>Coccyzi</i> whose nesting-habits
I am acquainted with, I can say that it never begins to incubate till the
full complement of eggs are laid&mdash;that its young are hatched simultaneously.
But if it is sought to trace the origin of the European
Cuckoo&rsquo;s instinct in the nesting-habits of American <i>Coccyzi</i>, it might be
attributed not to the aberrant habit of perhaps a single species, but to
another and more disadvantageous habit common to the entire genus,
viz., their habit of building exceedingly frail platform-nests from which
the eggs and young very frequently fall. By occasionally dropping an
egg in the deep, secure nest of some other bird, an advantage would be
possessed by the birds hatched in them, and in them the habit would
perhaps become hereditary. Be this as it may (and the one guess is
perhaps as wide of the truth as the other), there are many genera intermediate
between <i>Cuculus</i> and <i>Molothrus</i> in which no trace of a parasitic
habit appears; and it seems more than probable that the analogous
instincts originated in different ways in the two genera. As regards the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_82" id="Page_82">-&nbsp;82&nbsp;-</a>
origin of the instinct in <i>Molothrus</i>, it will perhaps seem premature to
found speculations on the few facts here recorded, and before we are
acquainted with the habits of other members of the genus. That a
species should totally lose so universal an instinct as the maternal one,
and yet avail itself of that affection in other species to propagate itself,
seems a great mystery. Nevertheless, I cannot refrain from all conjecture
on the subject, and will go so far as to suggest what may have
been at least one of the many concurrent causes that have produced
the parasitic instinct. The apparently transitional nesting-habits of
several species, and one remarkable habit of <i>M. bonariensis</i>, seem to me
to throw some light on a point bearing intimately on the subject, viz.,
the loss of the nest-making instinct in this species.</p>

<p>Habits vary greatly; were it not so, they would never seem so well
adapted to the conditions of life as we find them, since the conditions
themselves are not unchangeable. Thus it happens that, while a species
seems well adapted to its state in its habits, it frequently seems not so
well adapted in its relatively immutable structure. For example, without
going away from the pampas, we find a Tringa with the habits of
an upland Plover, a Tyrant-bird (<i>Pitangus bellicosus</i>) preying on mice
and snakes, another Tyrant-bird (<i>Myiotheretes rufiventris</i>) Plover-like in
its habits, and finally a Woodpecker (<i>Colaptes campestris</i>) that seeks its
food on the ground like a Starling; yet in none of these&mdash;and the list
might be greatly lengthened&mdash;has there been anything like a modification
of structure to keep pace with the altered manner of life. But,
however much the original or generic habits of a species may have become
altered&mdash;the habits of a species being widely different from those of its
congeners, also a want of correspondence between structure and habits
(the last being always more suited to conditions than the first) being
taken as evidence of such alteration&mdash;traces of ancient and disused
habits frequently reappear. Seemingly capricious actions too numerous,
too vague, or too insignificant to be recorded, improvised definite actions
that are not habitual, apparent imitations of the actions of other species,
a perpetual inclination to attempt something that is never attempted,
and attempts to do that which is never done&mdash;these and other like
motions are, I believe, in many cases to be attributed to the faint
promptings of obsolete instincts. To the same cause many of the
occasional aberrant habits of individuals may possibly be due&mdash;such as
of a bird that builds in trees occasionally laying on the ground. If
recurrence to an ancestral type be traceable in structure, coloration,
language, it is reasonable to expect something analogous to occur in
instincts. But even if such casual and often aimless motions as I have
mentioned should guide us unerringly to the knowledge of the old and<a class="pagenum" name="Page_83" id="Page_83">-&nbsp;83&nbsp;-</a>
disused instincts of a species, this knowledge of itself would not enable
us to discover the origin of present ones. But assuming it as a fact that
the conditions of existence, and the changes going on in them, are in
every case the fundamental cause of alterations in habits, I believe that
in many cases a knowledge of the disused instincts will assist us very
materially in the inquiry. I will illustrate my meaning with a supposititious
case. Should all or many species of <i>Columbid&aelig;</i> manifest an
inclination for haunting rocks and banks, and for entering or peering
into holes in them, such vague and purposeless actions, connected with
the facts that all Doves build simple platform-nests (like <i>Columba livia</i>
and others that build on a flat surface), also lay white eggs (the rule
being that eggs laid in dark holes are white, exposed eggs coloured),
also that one species, <i>C. livia</i>, does lay in holes in rocks, would lead
us to believe that the habit of this species was once common to the
genus. We should conclude that an insufficiency of proper breeding-places,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> new external conditions, first induced Doves to build in
trees. Thus <i>C. livia</i> also builds in trees where there are no rocks; but,
when able, returns to its ancestral habits. In the other species we
should believe the primitive habit to be totally lost from disuse, or
only to manifest itself in a faint uncertain manner.</p>

<p>Now, in <i>Molothrus bonariensis</i> we see just such a vague, purposeless
habit as the imaginary one I have described. Before and during the
breeding-season the females, sometimes accompanied by the males, are
seen continually haunting and examining the domed nests of some of
the Dendrocolaptid&aelig;. This does not seem like a mere freak of curiosity,
but their persistence in their investigations is precisely like that of birds
that habitually make choice of such breeding-places. It is surprising
that they never do actually lay in such nests, except when the side or
dome has been accidentally broken enough to admit the light into the
interior. Whenever I set boxes up in my trees, the female Cow-birds
were the first to visit them. Sometimes one will spend half a day
loitering about and inspecting a box, repeatedly climbing round and
over it, and always ending at the entrance, into which she peers curiously,
and when about to enter starting back, as if scared at the
obscurity within. But after retiring a little space she will return
again and again, as if fascinated with the comfort and security of such
an abode. It is amusing to see how pertinaciously they hang about
the ovens of the Oven-birds, apparently determined to take possession
of them, flying back after a hundred repulses, and yet not entering
them even when they have the opportunity. Sometimes one is seen
following a Wren or a Swallow to its nest beneath the eaves, and then
clinging to the wall beneath the hole into which it disappeared. I<a class="pagenum" name="Page_84" id="Page_84">-&nbsp;84&nbsp;-</a>
could fill many pages with instances of this habit of <i>M. bonariensis</i>,
which, useless though it be, is as strong an affection as the bird
possesses. That it is a recurrence to a long disused habit, I can
scarcely doubt; at least, to no other cause that I can imagine can it
be attributed; and, besides, it seems to me that if <i>M. bonariensis</i>,
when once a nest-builder, had acquired the semiparasitical habit of
breeding in domed nests of other birds, such a habit might conduce to
the formation of the instinct which it now possesses. I may mention
that twice I have seen birds of this species attempting to build nests,
and that on both occasions they failed to complete the work. So
universal is the nest-making instinct, that one might safely say the <i>M.
bonariensis</i> had once possessed it, and that in the cases I have mentioned
it was a recurrence, too weak to be efficient, to the ancestral habit.
Another interesting circumstance may be adduced as strong presumptive
evidence that <i>M. bonariensis</i> once made itself an open exposed
nest as <i>M. badius</i> occasionally does&mdash;viz., the difference in colour of
the male and female; for whilst the former is rich purple, the latter
possesses an adaptive resemblance in colour to nests and to the shaded
interior twigs and branches on which nests are usually built. How
could such an instinct have been lost? To say that the Cow-bird
occasionally dropped an egg in another bird&rsquo;s nest, and that the young
hatched from these accidental eggs possessed some (hypothetical)
advantage over those hatched in the usual way, and that the parasitical
habit so became hereditary, supplanting the original one, is an
assertion without any thing to support it, and seems to exclude the
agency of external conditions. Again the want of correspondence in
the habits of the young parasite and its foster-parents would in reality
be a disadvantage to the former; the unfitness would be as great in
the eggs and other circumstances; for all the advantages the parasite
actually possesses in the comparative hardness of the egg-shell, rapid
evolution of the young, &amp;c., already mentioned, must have been acquired
little by little through the slowly accumulating process of natural selection,
but subsequently to the formation of the original parasitical
inclination and habit. I am inclined to believe that <i>M. bonariensis</i>
lost the nest-making instinct by acquiring that semiparasitical habit,
common to so many South-American birds, of breeding in the large
covered nests of the Dendrocolaptid&aelig;. We have evidence that this
semiparasitical habit does tend to eradicate the nest-making one. The
<i>Synallaxes</i> build great elaborate domed nests, yet we have one species
(<i>S. &aelig;githaloides</i>) that never builds for itself, but breeds in the nests of
other birds of the same genus. In some species the nesting-habit is in
a transitional state. <i>Machetornis rixosa</i> sometimes makes an elaborate<a class="pagenum" name="Page_85" id="Page_85">-&nbsp;85&nbsp;-</a>
nest in the angle formed by twigs and the bough of a tree, but prefers,
and almost invariably makes choice of, the covered nest of some other
species or of a hole in the tree. It is precisely the same with our Wren,
<i>Troglodytes furvus</i>. The Yellow House-Sparrow (<i>Sycalis pelzelni</i>) invariably
breeds in a dark hole or covered nest. The fact that these three
species lay coloured eggs, and the first and last very darkly coloured eggs,
inclines one to believe that they once invariably built exposed nests, as
<i>M. rixosa</i> still occasionally does. It may be added that those species
that lay coloured eggs in dark places construct and line their nests far
more neatly than do the species that breed in such places but lay white
eggs. As with <i>M. rixosa</i> and the Wren, so it is with the Bay-winged
<i>Molothrus</i>; it lays mottled eggs, and occasionally builds a neat exposed
nest; yet so great is the partiality it has acquired for large domed nests,
that whenever it can possess itself of one by dint of fighting, it will not
build one for itself. Let us suppose that the Cow-bird also once
acquired the habit of breeding in domed nests, and that through this
habit its original nest-making instinct was completely eradicated, it is
not difficult to imagine how in its turn this instinct was also lost. A
diminution in the number of birds that built domed nests, or an increase
in the number of species and individuals that breed in such nests, would
involve <i>M. bonariensis</i> in a struggle for nests, in which it would
probably be defeated. In Buenos Ayres the White-rumped Swallow, the
Wren, and the Yellow Seed-finch prefer the ovens of the <i>Furnarius</i> to
any other breeding-place, but to obtain them are obliged to struggle with
<i>Progne tapera</i>; for this species has acquired the habit of breeding
exclusively in the ovens. They cannot, however, compete with the
<i>Progne</i>; and thus the increase of one species has, to a great extent,
deprived three other species of their favourite building-place. Again,
<i>Machetornis rixosa</i> prefers the great nest of the <i>Anumbius</i>; and when other
species compete with it for the nest they are invariably defeated. I have
seen a pair of <i>Machetornis</i> after they had seized a nest attacked in their
turn by a flock of six or eight Bay-wings; but, in spite of the superior
numbers, the fury of the <i>Machetornis</i> compelled them to raise the siege.</p>

<p>Thus some events in the history of our common <i>Molothrus</i> have
perhaps been accounted for, if not the most essential one&mdash;the loss
of the nest-making instinct from the acquisition of the habit of
breeding in the covered nests of other birds, a habit that has left a
strong trace in the manners of the species, and perhaps in the pure
white unmarked eggs of so many individuals; finally, we have seen
how this habit may also have been lost. But the parasitical habit of
the <i>M. bonariensis</i> may have originated when the bird was still a nest-builder.
The origin of the instinct may have been in the occasional<a class="pagenum" name="Page_86" id="Page_86">-&nbsp;86&nbsp;-</a>
habit, common to so many species, of two or more females laying
together; the progenitors of all the species of <i>Molothrus</i> may have been
early infected with this habit, and inherited with it a facility for acquiring
their present one. <i>M. pecoris</i> and <i>M. bonariensis</i>, though their instincts
differ, are both parasitic on a great number of species; <i>M. rufoaxillaris</i>
on <i>M. badius</i>; and in this last species two or more females frequently
lay together. If we suppose that the <i>M. bonariensis</i>, when it was a
nest-builder, or reared its own young in the nests it seized, possessed
this habit of two or more females frequently laying together, the young
of those birds that oftenest abandoned their eggs to the care of another
would probably inherit a weakened maternal instinct. The continual
intercrossing of individuals with weaker and stronger instincts would
prevent the formation of two races differing in habit; but the whole
race would degenerate, and would only be saved from filial extinction
by some individuals occasionally dropping their eggs in the nests of
other species, perhaps of a <i>Molothrus</i>, as <i>M. rufoaxillaris</i> still does,
rather than of birds of other genera. Certainly in this way the parasitic
instinct may have originated in <i>M. bonariensis</i> without that
species ever having acquired the habit of breeding in the covered dark
nests of other birds. I have supposed that they once possessed it only
to account for the strange attraction such nests have for them, which
seems like a recurrence to an ancestral habit.</p>

<p>This bird has no vulgar name, not being distinguished from the
Common Cow-bird by the country people. The English name of
Screaming Cow-bird, which I have bestowed on it, will, I think, commend
itself as appropriate to those who observe this bird, for they will
always and at any distance be able to distinguish it from the species it
resembles so nearly by listening to its impetuous screaming notes, so
unlike anything in the language of the Common Cow-bird.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_87" id="Page_87">-&nbsp;87&nbsp;-</a>The
Screaming Cow-bird is larger than the allied species. The
female is less than the male in size, but in colour they are alike, the
entire plumage being deep blue-black, glossy, and with purple reflections;
and under the wing at the joint there is a small rufous spot.
The beak is very stout, the plumage loose, and with a strong, musky
smell; the &oelig;sophagus remarkably wide.</p>

<p>It is far less common than the other species of <i>Molothrus</i>, but is not
rare, and ranges south to the Buenos-Ayrean pampas, where a few
individuals are usually found in every large plantation; and, like
the <i>M. badius</i>, it remains with us the whole year. It is not strictly
gregarious, but in winter goes in parties, never exceeding five or six
individuals, and in the breeding-season in pairs. One of its most
noteworthy traits is an exaggerated hurry and bustle thrown into all
its movements. When passing from one branch to another, it goes by
a series of violent jerks, smiting its wings loudly together; and when
a party of them return from the fields they rush wildly and loudly
screaming to the trees, as if pursued by a bird of prey. They are not
singing-birds; but the male sometimes, though rarely, attempts a song,
and utters, with considerable effort, a series of chattering unmelodious
notes. The chirp with which he invites his mate to fly has the sound of
a loud and smartly-given kiss. His warning or alarm-note when
approached in the breeding-season has a soft and pleasing sound; it is,
curiously enough, his only mellow expression. But his most common and
remarkable vocal performance is a cry beginning with a hollow-sounding
internal note, and swelling into a sharp metallic ring; this is uttered
with tail and wings spread and depressed, the whole plumage raised
like that of a strutting turkey-cock, whilst the bird hops briskly up and
down on its perch as if dancing. From its puffed-out appearance, and
from the peculiar character of the sound it emits, I believe that, like
the Pigeon and some other species, it has the faculty of filling its crop
with air, to use it as a &ldquo;chamber of resonance.&rdquo; The note I have
described is quickly and invariably followed by a scream, harsh and
impetuous, uttered by the female, though both notes always sound as if
proceeding from one bird. When on the wing the birds all scream
together in concert.</p>

<p>The food of this species is chiefly minute seeds and tender buds; they
also swallow large caterpillars and spiders, but do not, like their congeners,
eat hard insects.</p>

<p>I became familiar, even as a small boy, with the habits of the
Screaming Cow-bird, and before this species was known to naturalists,
but could never find its nest, though I sought diligently for it. I
could never see the birds collecting materials for a nest, or feeding their<a class="pagenum" name="Page_88" id="Page_88">-&nbsp;88&nbsp;-</a>
grown-up young like other species, and this might have made me
suspect that they did not hatch their own eggs; but it never occurred
to me that the bird was parasitical, I suppose because in summer they
are always seen in pairs, the male and female being inseparable.
Probably this is the only parasitical species in which there is conjugal
fidelity. I also noticed that, when approached in the breeding-season,
the pair always displayed great excitement and anxiety, like birds that
have a nest, or that have selected a site on which to build one. But
year after year the end of the summer would arrive, the birds reunite
in parties of half a dozen, and the mystery remain unsolved. At length,
after many years, fortune favoured me, and while observing the habits
of another species (<i>Molothrus badius</i>), I discovered by chance the
procreant habits of the Screaming Cow-birds; and as these observations
throw some light on the habits of <i>M. badius</i>, I think it best to transcribe
my notes here in full.</p>

<p>A pair of Le&ntilde;ateros (<i>Anumbius acuticaudatus</i>) have been nearly all
the winter building a nest on an acacia tree sixty yards from the house;
it is about 27 inches deep, and 16 or 18 in circumference, and appears
now nearly finished. I am sure that this nest will be attacked before
long, and I have resolved to watch it closely.</p>

<p>September 28.&mdash;To-day I saw a Bay-wing (<i>M. badius</i>) on the nest;
it climbed over it, deliberately inspecting every part with the critical air
of a proprietor who had ordered its construction, taking up and rearranging
some sticks and throwing others away from the nest. While
thus engaged, two common Cow-birds (<i>M. bonariensis</i>), male and female,
came to the tree; the female dropped on to the nest, and began also to
examine it, peering curiously into the entrance and quarrelling with
the first bird. After a few minutes she flew away, followed by her
glossy consort. The Bay-wing continued its strange futile work until
the owners of the nest appeared, whereupon it hopped aside in its usual
slow leisurely manner, sang for a few moments, then flew away. The
similarity in the behaviour of the two birds struck me very forcibly;
in the great interest they take in the nests of other birds, especially in
large covered nests, the two species are identical. But when the
breeding-season comes their habits begin to diverge: then the Common
Cow-bird lays in nests of other species, abandoning its eggs to their
care; while the Bay-wings usually seize on the nests of other birds and
rear their own young. Yet, as they do occasionally build a neat
elaborate nest for themselves, the habit of taking possession of the nests
of other birds is, most likely, a recently acquired one, and probably its
tendency is to eradicate the original building instinct.</p>

<p>October 8.&mdash;This morning, while reading under a tree, my attention<a class="pagenum" name="Page_89" id="Page_89">-&nbsp;89&nbsp;-</a>
was aroused by a shrill note, as of a bird in distress, issuing from the
neighbourhood of the Le&ntilde;atero&rsquo;s nest; after hearing it repeated at
intervals for over twenty minutes, I went to ascertain the cause. Two
Bay-wings flew up from the ground under the nest, and on searching
in the rank clover growing under the tree, I discovered the female
Le&ntilde;atero, with plumage wet and draggled, trembling and appearing
half dead with the rough treatment she had experienced. I put her in
the sun, and after half an hour, hearing her mate calling, she managed
to flutter feebly away to join him. The persecutors had dragged her
out of the nest, and would, no doubt, have killed her, had I not come
so opportunely to the rescue.</p>

<p>Since writing the above, I have continued to watch the nest. Both
the Bay-wings and Le&ntilde;ateros left it for some days. Six days after
picking up the ill-treated female, the Le&ntilde;ateros came back and resumed
possession. Four days later the Bay-wings also came back; but on
finding the nest still occupied, they took possession of an unfinished
oven of an Oven-bird on another tree within twenty yards of the first,
and immediately began carrying in materials with which to line it.
When they had finished laying I took their five eggs, at the same time
throwing down the oven, and waited to see what their next move
would be. They remained on the spot singing incessantly, and still
manifesting anxiety when approached. I observed them four days, and
then was absent from home as many more; on returning, I found that
the Le&ntilde;ateros had once more disappeared, and that the nest was now
held by the Bay-wings. I also noticed that they had opened an
entrance very low down at the side of the nest which they were using;
no doubt they had killed and thrown out the young Le&ntilde;ateros.</p>

<p>It was now early in November, the height of the breeding-season,
and numbers of Common Cow-birds constantly visited the nest; but I
was particularly interested in a pair of Screaming Cow-birds that had
also began to grow fond of it, and I resolved to watch them closely.
As they spent so much of their time near the nest, showing great solicitude
when I approached it, I strongly hoped to see them breed in it,
if the Bay-wings could only be got rid of. The Screaming Cow-birds
would not, or dared not, attack them; and, as I always think that the
worst possible use one can put a little bird to is to shoot it, I could
not help them by destroying the Bay-wings. I therefore resolved
to take their eggs, hoping that that would cause them to leave in
disgust.</p>

<p>When I was satisfied from their movements that they had finished
laying, I got up to the nest, and was astonished to find <i>ten</i> eggs instead
of five, as I had confidently expected; for, though the Common Cow-birds<a class="pagenum" name="Page_90" id="Page_90">-&nbsp;90&nbsp;-</a>
had paid a great deal of attention to the nest, I knew the Bay-wings
would not allow <i>them</i> to lay in it.</p>

<p>The ten eggs in the nest were all unmistakably Bay-wing&rsquo;s eggs;
and having observed before that several females do occasionally lay
together, I concluded that in this case two females had laid in the nest,
though I had only seen two birds&mdash;male and female. After taking the
ten eggs the Bay-wings still remained, and in a very short time they
appeared to be laying again. When I had reason to think that the full
complement was laid, I visited the nest and found five eggs in it; these
I also took, and concluded that the second female had probably gone
away, after having been deprived of her first clutch. During all this
time the Screaming Cow-birds remained in the neighbourhood and
occasionally visited the tree; but to my very great surprise the Bay-wings
still stubbornly remained, and by-and-by I found that they were
going to lay again&mdash;the fourth time! When I next visited the nest
there were two eggs in it; I left them and returned three days later,
expecting to find five eggs, but found seven! certainly more than one
female had laid in the nest on this occasion. After taking these last
seven eggs the Bay-wings left; and though the Screaming Cow-birds
continued to make occasional visits to the nest, to my great disappointment
they did not lay in it.</p>

<p>April 12.&mdash;To-day I have made a discovery, and am as pleased with
it as if I had found a new planet in the sky. The mystery of the Bay-wings&rsquo;
nest twice found containing over the usual complement of eggs
is cleared up, and I have now suddenly become acquainted with the
procreant instinct of the Screaming Cow-bird. I look on this as a great
piece of good fortune; for I had thought that the season for making
any such discovery was already over, as we are so near to winter.</p>

<p>The Bay-wings are so social in their habits that they always appear
reluctant to break up their companies in the breeding-season; no
sooner is this over, and while the young birds are still fed by the
parents, all the families about a plantation unite into one flock.
About a month ago all the birds about my home had associated in this
way together, and went in a scattered flock, frequenting one favourite
feeding-spot very much, a meadow about fifteen minutes&rsquo; walk from the
house. The flock was composed, I believe, of three families, sixteen or
eighteen birds in all: the young birds are indistinguishable from the
adults; but I knew that most of these birds were young hatched late
in the season, from their incessant strident hunger-notes. I first
observed them about the middle of March. A week ago, while riding
past the meadow where they were feeding, I noticed among them three
individuals with purple spots on their plumage. They were at a<a class="pagenum" name="Page_91" id="Page_91">-&nbsp;91&nbsp;-</a>
distance from me, and I naturally concluded that they were young
Common Cow-birds (<i>M. bonariensis</i>), casually associating with the Bay-wings.
I was surprised to see them, for the young male <i>M. bonariensis</i>
always acquires the purple plumage before March, so that these
individuals were changing colour five weeks after the usual time. To-day,
while out with my gun, I came upon the flock, and noticed four
of the birds assuming the purple plumage, two of them being almost
entirely that colour; but I also noticed with astonishment that they
had bay- or chestnut-coloured wings, also that those with least purple
on them were marvellously like the Bay-wings in the mouse-coloured
plumage of the body and the dark tail. I had seen these birds before
the purple plumage was acquired, and there was then not the slightest
difference amongst them, the adults and their supposed offspring being
alike; now some of them appeared to be undergoing the process of a
transmutation into another species! I at once shot the four spotted
birds along with two genuine Bay-wings, and was delighted to find that
the first were young Screaming Cow-birds.</p>

<p>I must now believe that the extra eggs twice found in the nest of the
Bay-wings were those of the Screaming Cow-bird, that the latter species
lays chiefly in the nests of the former, that the eggs of the two species
are identical in form, size, and colour, each bird also laying five, and
that, stranger still, the similarity is as perfect in the young birds as it
is in the eggs.</p>

<p>April 15.&mdash;This morning I started in quest of the Bay-wings, and
observed one individual, that had somehow escaped detection the day
before, assuming the purple dress. This bird I shot; and after the
flock had resettled a short distance off, I crept close up to them, under
the shelter of a hedge, to observe them more narrowly. One of the
adults was closely attended by three young birds; and these all, while
I watched them, fluttered their wings and clamoured for food every
time the old bird stirred on its perch. The three young birds seemed
precisely alike; but presently I noticed that one of them had a few
minute purple spots, and on shooting this one I found it to be a young
<i>M. rufoaxillaris</i>, while the other two were true young Bay-wings.</p>

<p>The hunger-cry of the young <i>M. badius</i> (Bay-wing) is quite different
from that of the young <i>M. bonariensis</i>: the cry of the latter is a long,
shrill, two-syllabled note, the last syllable being prolonged into a continuous
squeal when the foster-parent approaches with food; the cry of
the young <i>M. badius</i> is short, reedy, tremulous, and uninflected. The
resemblance of the young <i>M. rufoaxillaris</i> to its foster-brothers in
language and plumage is the more remarkable when we reflect that
the adult bird in its habits, gestures, guttural notes, also in its deep<a class="pagenum" name="Page_92" id="Page_92">-&nbsp;92&nbsp;-</a>
purple plumage, comes much nearer to <i>M. bonariensis</i> than to <i>M. badius</i>.
It seems impossible for mimicry to go further than this. A slight
difference in size is quite imperceptible when the birds are flying about;
while in language and plumage the keenest ornithologist would not be
able to detect a difference. But it may be questioned whether this is
really a case of an external resemblance of one species to another
acquired by natural selection for its better preservation. Possibly the
young <i>M. rufoaxillaris</i>, in the first stage of its plumage, exhibits the
ancestral type&mdash;that of the progenitor of both species. If <i>M. badius</i>
belonged to some other group&mdash;<i>Sturnella</i> or <i>Pseudoleistes</i>, for instance&mdash;it
would scarcely be possible to doubt that the resemblance of the young
<i>M. rufoaxillaris</i> to its foster-brothers resulted from mimicry; but as
both species belong to the limited, well-defined group <i>Molothrus</i>, the
resemblance may be ascribed to community of descent.</p>

<p>Formerly I believed that though <i>M. badius</i> is constantly seen rearing
its own young, they also occasionally dropped their eggs in the
nests of other birds. I could not doubt that this was the case after
having witnessed a couple of their young following a Yellowbreast and
being fed by it. I must now alter my opinion, for what then appeared
to be proof positive is now no proof at all, for those two birds were
probably the young of <i>M. rufoaxillaris</i>. There are, however, good
reasons for believing that <i>M. rufoaxillaris</i> is parasitical almost exclusively
on <i>M. badius</i>. I have spoken of the many varieties of eggs
<i>M. bonariensis</i> lays. Those of <i>M. badius</i> are a trifle less in size, in
form elliptical, densely and uniformly marked with small spots and
blotches of dark reddish colour, varying to dusky brown; the ground-colour
is white, but sometimes, though rarely, pale blue. It is not
possible to confound the eggs of the two species. Now, ever since I
saw, many years ago, the Yellowbreast feeding the supposed young
Bay-wings, I have looked out for the eggs of the latter in other birds&rsquo;
nests. I have found hundreds of nests containing eggs of <i>M. bonariensis</i>,
but never one with an egg of <i>M. badius</i>, and, I may now add, never one
with an egg of <i>M. rufoaxillaris</i>. It is wonderful that <i>M. rufoaxillaris</i>
should lay only in the nests of <i>M. badius</i>; but the most mysterious thing
is that <i>M. bonariensis</i>, indiscriminately parasitical on a host of species,
never, to my knowledge, drops an egg in the nest of <i>M. badius</i>, unless
it be in a forsaken nest! Perhaps it will be difficult for naturalists to
believe this; for if the <i>M. badius</i> is so excessively vigilant and jealous
of other birds approaching its nest as to succeed in keeping out the
subtle, silent, grey-plumaged, omnipresent female <i>M. bonariensis</i>, why
does it not also keep off the far rarer, noisy, bustling, conspicuously
coloured <i>M. rufoaxillaris</i>? I cannot say. The only explanation that<a class="pagenum" name="Page_93" id="Page_93">-&nbsp;93&nbsp;-</a>
has occurred to me is that <i>M. badius</i> is sagacious enough to distinguish
the eggs of the common parasite, and throws them out of its nest.
But this is scarcely probable, for I have hunted in vain under the
trees for the ejected eggs; and I have never found the eggs of <i>M.
badius</i> with holes pecked in the shells, which would have been the case
had a <i>M. bonariensis</i> intruded into the nest.</p>

<p>With the results just recorded I felt more than satisfied, though so
much still remained to be known; and I looked forward to the next
summer to work out the rich mine on which I had stumbled by chance.
Unhappily, when spring came round again ill-health kept me a prisoner
in the city, and finding no improvement in my condition, I eventually
left Buenos Ayres at the close of the warm season to try whether
change of climate would benefit me. Before leaving, however, I spent
a few days at home, and saw enough then to satisfy me that my
conclusions were correct. Most of the birds had finished breeding,
but while examining some nests of <i>Anumbius</i> I found one which Bay-wings
had tenanted, and which for some reason they had forsaken
leaving <i>ten</i> unincubated eggs. They were all like Bay-wings&rsquo; eggs,
but I have no doubt that five of them were eggs of <i>M. rufoaxillaris</i>.
During my rides in the neighbourhood I also found two flocks of Bay-wings,
each composed of several families, and amongst the young birds
I noticed several individuals beginning to assume the purple plumage,
like those of the previous autumn. I did not think it necessary to
shoot more specimens.</p>

<p>The question, why <i>M. badius</i> permits <i>M. rufoaxillaris</i> to use its
nest, while excluding the allied parasite, <i>M. bonariensis</i>, must be
answered by future observers; but before passing from this very
interesting group (<i>Molothrus</i>) I wish to make some general remarks on
their habits and their anomalous relations to other species.</p>

<p>It is with a considerable degree of repugnance that we regard the
parasitical instincts in birds; the reason it excites such a feeling is
manifestly because it presents itself to the mind as&mdash;to use the words
of a naturalist of the last century, who was also a theologian, and
believed the Cuckoo had been created with such a habit&mdash;&ldquo;a monstrous
outrage on the maternal affection, one of the first great dictates of
nature.&rdquo; An <i>outrage</i>, since each creature has been endowed with this
all-powerful affection for the preservation of its own, and not another,
species; and here we see it, by a subtle process, an unconscious iniquity,
turned from its purpose, perverted and made subservient to the very
opposing agency against which it was intended as a safeguard! The
formation of such an instinct seems indeed like an unforeseen contingency
in the system of nature, a malady strengthened, if not<a class="pagenum" name="Page_94" id="Page_94">-&nbsp;94&nbsp;-</a>
induced, by the very laws established for the preservation of health,
and which the <i>vis medicatrix</i> of nature is incapable of eliminating.
Again, the egg of a parasitical species is generally so much larger,
differing also in coloration from the eggs it is placed with, whilst
there is such an unvarying dissimilarity between the young bird
and its living or murdered foster-brothers, that, unreasoning as we
know instinct, and especially the maternal instinct, is, we are shocked
at so glaring and flagrant an instance of its blind stupidity.</p>

<p>In the competition for place, the struggle for its existence, said with
reason to be most deadly between such species as are most nearly allied,
the operations are imperceptible, and the changes are so gradual, that the
diminution and filial disappearance of one species is never attributed
to a corresponding increase in another more favoured species over
the same region. It is not as if the regnant species had invaded
and seized on the province of another, but appears rather as if they
had quietly entered on the possession of an inheritance that was theirs
by right. Mighty as are the results worked out by such a process, it is
only by a somewhat strained metaphor that it can be called a <i>struggle</i>.
But even when the war is open and declared, as between a raptorial
species and its victims, the former is manifestly driven by necessity.
And in this case the species preyed on are endowed with peculiar sagacity
to escape its persecutions; so that the war is not one of extermination,
but, as in a border war, the invader is satisfied with carrying off the
weak and unwary stragglers. Thus the open, declared enmity is
in reality beneficial to a species; for it is sure to cut off all such
individuals as might cause its degeneration. But we can conceive no
necessity for such a fatal instinct as that of the Cuckoo and Cow-bird
destructive to such myriads of lives in their beginning. And inasmuch
as their preservation is inimical to the species on which they
are parasitical, there must also here be a struggle. But what kind
of struggle? Not as in other species, where one perishes in the
combat that gives greater strength to the victor, but an anomalous
struggle in which one of the combatants has made his adversary turn
his weapons against himself, and so seems to have an infinite advantage.
It is impossible for him to suffer defeat; and yet, to follow out the
metaphor, he has so wormed about and interlaced himself with his
opponent that as soon as he succeeds in overcoming him he also must
inevitably perish. Such a result is perhaps impossible, as there are
so many causes operating to check the undue increase of any one
species: consequently the struggle, unequal as it appears, must continue
for ever. Thus, in whatever way we view the parasitical habit, it
appears cruel, treacherous, and vicious in the highest degree. But<a class="pagenum" name="Page_95" id="Page_95">-&nbsp;95&nbsp;-</a>
should we attempt to mentally create a perfect parasitical instinct
(that is, one that would be thoroughly efficient with the least
possible prejudice to or injustice towards another species; for the
preservation of the species on which the parasite is dependent is
necessary to its own) by combining in imagination all known parasitical
habits, eliminating every offensive quality or circumstance, and attributing
such others in their place as we should think fit, our conception
would probably still fall short in simplicity, beauty, and completeness
of the actual instinct of <i>M. rufoaxillaris</i>. Instead of laying its
eggs promiscuously in every receptacle that offers, it selects the nest
of a single species; so that its selective instinct is related to the
adaptive resemblance in its eggs and young to those of the species on
which it is parasitical. Such an adaptive resemblance could not of
course exist if it laid its eggs in the nests of more than one species,
and it is certainly a circumstance eminently favourable to preservation.
Then, there not being any such incongruity and unfitness as we find in
nests into which other parasites intrude, there is no reason here to
regard the foster-parents&rsquo; affection as blind and stupid; the similarity
being close enough to baffle the keenest sagacity. Nor can the instinct
here appear in the light of an outrage on the maternal affection; for the
young <i>M. rufoaxillaris</i> possesses no advantage over its foster-brothers.
It is not endowed with greater strength and voracity to monopolize the
attentions of the foster-parent or to eject the real offspring; but being
in every particular precisely like them, it has only an equal chance of
being preserved. To this wonderful parasitical instinct we may well
apply Darwin&rsquo;s words, when speaking of the architecture of the hive-bee:&mdash;&ldquo;Beyond
this stage of perfection natural selection could not
lead.&rdquo;</p>

quills cinnamon-colour; beak and legs black. Azara describing it
under the name of <i>Tordo pardo roxiso</i>, says it is a rare bird, so that it
has probably greatly increased since his time, as it is now quite common
in the Plata district.</p>

<p>The Bay-wings usually go in small flocks, numbering from ten to
thirty individuals, and are not migratory, but in winter they travel
about a great deal from place to place without extending their journeys
more than a few miles in any direction. They are fond of coming
about houses, and are frequently seen pecking at the fresh meat
hanging out of doors; and, like other birds of the same tribe, feed
chiefly on the ground. They spend a great portion of their time on trees,
are familiar with man and inactive, and in their motions singularly
slow and deliberate. Their language is varied. Curiosity or alarm is
expressed by trilling notes, and before quitting a tree all the birds of a
flock ceremoniously invite each other to fly with long clear notes,
powerful enough to be heard a quarter of a mile away.</p>

<p>They also sing a great deal in all seasons, the song being composed
of soft, clear, rather sweet notes, variously modulated, uttered in a
leisurely manner, and seeming to express a composed frame of mind, all
the birds in a flock singing in concert. During the cold season the
flock always finds some sheltered sunny spot on the north side of a woodpile
or hedge, where they spend several hours every day, sitting still
and singing in their usual quiet, soft style.</p>

<p>Their extreme sociability affects their breeding-habits, for sometimes
the flock does not break up in spring, and several females lay in one
nest together; but whether the birds are paired or practice a promiscuous
intercourse, I have not been able to discover. They have a
great partiality for the large domed nests made by the <i>Anumbius acuticaudatus</i>,
called Le&ntilde;atero in the vernacular. One summer a flock of
about ten Bay-wings took possession of a Le&ntilde;atero&rsquo;s nest on one of
my trees, and after a few days I took fourteen eggs from it. Though
the birds hopped, chirping round me, manifesting great solicitude,
the eggs were quite cold, and had I left them many more would
have been laid, no doubt; but as they were piled up three or four deep
in the nest they could never have been hatched.</p>

<p>As a rule, however, the flock breaks up into pairs; and then a neat,
well-made nest is built in the fork of a branch, lined with horsehair;
or, oftener still, a Le&ntilde;atero&rsquo;s nest is seized, the Bay-wings fighting
with great spirit to get possession, and in it, or on it, their own nest is
made. Like their relations, the Common Cow-bird, they seem strongly
attracted by domed nests, and yet shrink from laying in the dark<a class="pagenum" name="Page_97" id="Page_97">-&nbsp;97&nbsp;-</a>
interior; as a rule when they have captured a Le&ntilde;atero&rsquo;s nest they
break a hole in the side and so admit the light and form an easy
entrance. One summer a pair of Bay-wings attacked a Le&ntilde;atero&rsquo;s
nest on one of my trees; the fighting was kept up for three or four
days, and then at the foot of the tree I found five young Le&ntilde;ateros,
fully fledged, which had been pecked to death and thrown out of the
nest.</p>

<p>The eggs of the Bay-wing are five in number, nearly round, and
densely marked with dusky reddish brown.</p>

<p>Once I observed two young Bay-wings following a Yellow-breast
(<i>Pseudoleistes virescens</i>) with their usual peculiar hunger-cry, and
while I watched them they were fed several times by their foster-parents.
Naturally I concluded that the Bay-winged Cow-bird is
sometimes parasitical on other species, but I never saw anything afterwards
to confirm me in that belief, and I believe now that I was
mistaken, and that the young Bay-wings were not <i>real</i> Bay-wings,
but the young of <i>Molothrus rufoaxillaris</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Hab.</i> S. Peru, Chili, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>

<p>This bird is abundant everywhere on the pampas, and does not
migrate, but inhabits marshy situations in summer, building its nest
amongst the rushes, and in winter ranges over the country. The male
is entirely of an intense black, except the shoulders, which are pure
yellow; the female is dull grey with fuscous markings, and, as was
long ago remarked by Azara, the grey-plumaged are very much more
numerous than the black individuals. The young birds are like the
females, and possibly do not acquire the full black plumage until the
second year, which would account for the great number of grey birds.</p>

<p>These birds are extremely sociable, being seen in flocks all the year<a class="pagenum" name="Page_98" id="Page_98">-&nbsp;98&nbsp;-</a>
round, even during the breeding-season; in winter a great many males
separate themselves from the females, and are found associating
together in flocks of from thirty to forty individuals.</p>

<p>They feed on the ground, keeping to the moist borders of marshes
during summer; they avoid woods, but occasionally alight on trees,
where they all sing in concert. The song, when an individual is heard
singing alone, is, though limited in its range, very sweet, some of the
notes being remarkable for their purity and expression. The bird sits
on a rush or stalk while singing, and makes a long pause after every
note or two, as if to make the most of its limited repertory. There is
in the song one rich full note, which, to my mind, is unequalled for
plaintive sweetness, and I am therefore surprised that Azara says only
of this species that it sings passably well&mdash;&lsquo;<i>canta razonablemente</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The nest is neatly made of dry grasses, and attached to the rushes
growing in the water. The eggs are four, pointed, and spotted at the
larger end with dull brown and black on a white ground.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina.</p>

<p>Azara called this bird <i>Cabeza amarilla</i>, or Yellow-head. It is found
throughout the eastern provinces of the Argentine country, ranging
south to about the thirty-sixth degree of latitude, and is also common
in the Banda Oriental.</p>

<p>The dull-plumaged birds are always very much more numerous than
the bright-coloured males, though Azara strangely asserts that the sexes
are alike. In Buenos Ayres, where it is called &ldquo;Naranjo&rdquo; by the
country people in allusion to its orange tints, it is very well known on
account of its yellow plumage, which looks so wonderfully brilliant in the
sunshine, and its partiality for cultivated districts, where it follows the
plough to pick up worms, and frequents the orchard to sing, associating
with the common Cow-bird and Yellow-breast. It remains all the
year, and is very sociable, going in flocks of from twenty to fifty<a class="pagenum" name="Page_99" id="Page_99">-&nbsp;99&nbsp;-</a>
individuals, which when they settle on the trees all sing in concert,
pouring out their few peculiar notes with great power and emphasis.</p>

<p>Even in the breeding-season these companies do not always break up,
and frequently several pairs have nests near together. The nest is
usually built in a cardoon thistle, two or three feet above the ground,
and is made of dry grass. The eggs are four, pointed, white or with a
bluish tinge, and speckled irregularly with deep brown, the spots being
closer and sometimes confluent at the broad end.</p>

<p>Concerning the plumage of this species Mr. Barrows writes:&mdash;&ldquo;Late
in March, 1881, we found this species in large flocks on the Pigu&eacute;,
and it was a beautiful sight to see a hundred or more fluttering about
among the snowy plumes of the pampas grass, and displaying their rich
black and yellow dress. Unlike most other birds obtained at that time,
their plumage seemed nearly as bright and fresh as in summer.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Argentina and Paraguay.</p>

<p>The sexes are alike in this species: the crown of the head is rufous,
and with this exception the whole plumage a rich glossy blue-black.
The beauty of the bird and its delicate, plaintive voice would no doubt
make it a favourite with man if he saw more of it, only it lives and
breeds in marshes, and does not come near his habitations. The Red-heads
are gregarious and migratory. The flock can scarcely be said to
break up in the breeding-season, as the birds all make their nests near
together in the reeds. The nest is placed about one or two feet above
the water, is about six inches in depth, and made of leaves and aquatic
grasses woven together. The eggs are four, pointed, with a white or
pale bluish ground, and spotted with black at the larger end.</p>

<p>The song of the Red-head is quite unique in character. It begins
with a low, hollow-sounding note, then the voice changes to a clear,
sorrowful tone, rising in a rapid succession of short notes, and falling
again in longer ones.</p>

<p>After the breeding-season the birds fly about in flocks of two or three
hundred individuals, and sing in concert on the trees.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_100" id="Page_100">-&nbsp;100&nbsp;-</a>Their

lower belly striated with black; tail cinereous brown, with black cross bars.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Argentina, Paraguay, and E. Brazil.</p>

<p>The most interesting point concerning this species is the very great
difference in habits, as well as appearance, existing between the sexes.
In form it resembles the Starling of Europe, but is a trifle smaller and
has a shorter tail. The male is black, the upper parts faintly mottled
with yellowish grey; there is a straw-coloured stripe over the eye; the
throat and breast bright crimson. The female is a smaller bird, and in
colour dull fulvous grey, mottled with fuscous; the red tint on the
breast scarcely perceptible.</p>

<p>These birds are migratory, and appear everywhere in the eastern part
of the Argentine country early in October, arriving singly, after which
each male takes up a position in a field or open space abounding with
coarse grass and herbage, where he spends most of the time perched on
the summit of a tall stalk or weed, his glowing crimson bosom showing
at a distance like some splendid flower above the herbage. At intervals
of two or three minutes he soars vertically up to a height of twenty or
twenty-five yards to utter his song, composed of a single long, powerful,
and rather musical note, ending with an attempt at a flourish, during
which the bird flutters and turns about in the air; then, as if discouraged
at his failure, he drops down, emitting harsh guttural chirps,
to resume his stand. Meanwhile, the female is invisible, keeping closely
concealed under the long grass. But at length, attracted perhaps by
the bright bosom and aerial music of the male, she occasionally exhibits
herself for a few moments, starting up with a wild, zigzag flight, like a
Snipe flushed from its marsh, and, darting this way and that, presently
drops into the grass once more. The moment she appears above the
grass the male gives chase, and they vanish from sight together. Thus,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_101" id="Page_101">-&nbsp;101&nbsp;-</a>
while in colour, habits, language, and even in its manner of soaring up
like a rocket to let off its curious melody, the male is the most conspicuous
of small birds, the female, acted on in an opposite direction by
natural selection, has been, so to speak, effaced. While flying, they do
not look like birds of the same species: the male moves with wings
rapidly fluttered, like a Starling, but with a slower, more laborious flight,
and without deviating; the female, in her eccentric movements in the
air, reminds one of a large moth driven from its hiding-place, and flying
about confused with the glare of noon.</p>

<p>The nest is made of dry grass on the ground, so cunningly concealed
that it is most difficult to find. The eggs are four, white, spotted
with reddish brown. When they have young, I have never been able to
detect the female flying about in search of food.</p>

<p>All through the summer these birds are solitary, but when migrating
in the autumn, though many are seen travelling singly, and appear very
conspicuous as they fly laboriously in a straight line, at an altitude
of about twenty yards from the surface, others are seen making their
journey in small flocks or parties composed of six to a dozen individuals.
These are the males. The females travel separately, in twos or threes or
singly, flying nearer to the earth, with frequent pauses, when the wings
cease beating, and intervals of gliding, also darting occasionally to one
side, as if the bird had suddenly taken fright.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina.</p>

<p>Azara named this species <i>Tordo negro cabeza roxa</i>; it is also called
<i>Boyero</i> (ox-herd) by country people, from its note resembling the long
whistle of a drover; and sometimes <i>Chisel-bill</i>, from the peculiar conformation
of the beak, which is long, straight, and has a broad fine
point like a chisel. In both sexes the plumage of the head and neck
is scarlet, of an exceedingly brilliant tint, all other parts intense black.<a class="pagenum" name="Page_102" id="Page_102">-&nbsp;102&nbsp;-</a>
These birds are lively, active, and sociable, going in flocks of from half-a-dozen
to thirty individuals; they remain all the year, and inhabit the
marshes, from which they seldom wander very far, but seek their insect
food in the soft decaying rushes. They are common on the swampy shores
of the Plata, and when seen at a distance, perched in their usual manner
on the summits of the tall rushes, their flame-coloured heads shine with
a strange glory above the sere sombre vegetation of the marshes. The
long whistling note above mentioned is their only song, but it varies
considerably, and often sounds as mellow and sweet as the whistle of the
European Blackbird.</p>

<p>The nest is an ingenious structure of dry grasses, fastened to the
upright stems of an aquatic plant, three or four feet above the water.
The eggs are four, in size and form like those of the English Song-Thrush,
spotted somewhat sparsely with black on a light blue ground.</p>

<p>The young birds are entirely black at first, and afterwards assume on
the head and neck a pale terra-cotta red, which gradually deepens to
vivid scarlet.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Hab.</i> S. Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina.</p>

<p>In both sexes in this species the plumage is deep olivaceous brown,
the breast pure yellow. It is active, strong on the wing, sociable and
noisy; and being moreover a pretty and elegant bird, very common in
settled districts, and with a preference for man&rsquo;s neighbourhood, it is
familiar to every one, and has won amongst many competitors the
vernacular name of <i>Pecho-amarillo</i> (Yellow-breast), for with us yellow-breasted
species are somewhat numerous. It remains all the year,
invariably going about in flocks of from twenty to thirty birds, and feeds
on the ground in the fields or on the open plain. While they are feeding,
one bird takes up a position on a stalk or thistle-top to keep guard;
when he flies down another bird takes his place; if a person approaches,
the sentinel gives the alarm, and all the birds fly off in a very close<a class="pagenum" name="Page_103" id="Page_103">-&nbsp;103&nbsp;-</a>
flock, making the air resound with their loud ringing notes. After
feeding, they repair to the trees, where they join their robust voices in
a spirited concert, without any set form of melody such as other song-birds
possess, but all together, flinging out their notes at random, as if
mad with joy. In this delightful hubbub there are some soft silvery
sounds. Where they are never persecuted they have little fear of man,
but they invariably greet his approach with a loud vigorous remonstrance.</p>

<p>In October the birds break up their companies to pair. Sometimes
they breed on the open plain in a large cardoon thistle, but a thick
bush or low tree is preferred. The nest is like that of a Thrush, being
deep, compactly made of dry grass and slender sticks, plastered inside
with mud, and lined with hair or soft dry grass. It is, however, deeper
and more symmetrical than the Thrush&rsquo;s nest, and it is sometimes
plastered with cow-dung instead of with mud. The eggs are four, very
long, white, and abundantly spotted with deep red, the spots becoming
confluent at the large end.</p>

<p>The Yellow-breast is never seen to quarrel with its fellows or with
other birds, and it is possibly due to its peaceful disposition that it is
more victimized by the parasitical <i>Molothrus</i> than any other bird. I
have frequently found their nests full of parasitical eggs, as many as
fourteen and in one case sixteen, eggs in one nest. In some seasons
all the nests I found and watched were eventually abandoned by
the birds on account of the number of parasitical eggs dropped in them.
I have also so frequently found parasitical eggs on the ground under
the nest that I believe the Yellow-breast throws out some of these
foreign eggs, and in one instance I was quite sure that this had
happened. The nest was in a cardoon bush, and contained five eggs&mdash;two
of the Yellow-breast and three parasitical. These three were of
the variety most thickly mottled with red, and consequently closely
resembling the eggs of the Yellow-breast. I was surprised to find five
more eggs of the Cow-bird on the ground, close together, and about
three feet from the bush; and these five eggs were all pure white and
unspotted. Naturally I asked, How came these eggs in such a position?
They had not fallen from the nest, which was very deep, contained
few eggs, and was scarcely thirty inches above the ground.
Then they were all white, while those in the nest were mottled. That
the eggs had been laid in the nest I felt certain; and the only way I
can account for their being in the place where I found them is that
the Yellow-breast itself removed them, taking them up in its bill and
flying with them to the ground. If I am right, we must believe that
this individual Yellow-breast had developed an instinct unusual in the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_104" id="Page_104">-&nbsp;104&nbsp;-</a>
species, which enables it to distinguish, and cast out of its nest, eggs
very different from its own&mdash;an instinct, in fact, the object of which
would be to counteract the parasitical habit of <i>Molothrus</i>. What would
be the effect of such an instinct should the species acquire it? Doubtless
it would be highly prejudicial to the parasitical birds laying white
eggs, but favourable to those laying mottled eggs. This would be
natural selection operating in a very unusual manner; for the Yellow-breast,
or other species, would improve another to its own detriment,
since the more the parasitical eggs assimilated to its own, the greater
would be the likelihood of their being preserved. The perfect similarity
of the eggs of <i>M. rufoaxillaris</i> to those of <i>M. badius</i> perhaps was
brought about in this way. But, it may be added, if besides the
Yellow-breast some one other species laying very different eggs (a
<i>Zonotrichia</i> or <i>Tyrannus</i>, for instance) should also acquire this distinguishing
habit, and eject all eggs unlike its own from its nest, the
habit in the two or more species would ultimately cause the extinction
of the parasite.</p>

<p>It might throw some light on this obscure subject to examine, for
several successive summers, a large number of nests, to ascertain
whether the nests of the Yellow-breast are often found without any
white unspotted eggs, or if the same proportional number of white
(parasitical) eggs are found in the nests of the Yellow-breast, Scissor-tail,
Song-Sparrow, Pipit, and other species.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Chili, Patagonia, and Falkland Islands.</p>

<p>Two species of <i>Trupialis</i> inhabit the southernmost part of the Argentine
Republic, the present being confined to Patagonia and South<a class="pagenum" name="Page_105" id="Page_105">-&nbsp;105&nbsp;-</a>
Chili, while its northern representative inhabits the pampas of Buenos
Ayres and Uruguay. Probably the Colorado River, which separates
two districts differing in soil and vegetation, is the boundary-line
dividing their habitats. So nearly alike are these two birds in colour,
language, and habits, that they seem rather like races than species; and
they were so regarded by naturalists until recently, when the pampas
bird was raised to the rank of a distinct species, with the name of
<i>Trupialis defilippii</i>. Unfortunately the old name <i>militaris</i> fits the
Pampas, and not the Patagonian, Starling best; but of this I shall speak
when I describe the former species.</p>

<p>In form and size <i>T. militaris</i> resembles the Common Starling of
Europe, but differs from it in habits, flight, language, and in colouring;
its upper plumage being fuscous mottled with yellowish grey, the
throat and bosom scarlet inclining to crimson. This hue varies greatly,
the breast-feathers being often tipped with white, which subdues the
intense red, and gives it a rosy tint in some individuals. The female is
paler-plumaged than the male, and has less red on the breast.</p>

<p>It inhabits the whole of Patagonia to the Strait of Magellan, but is
confined to the valleys or to the neighbourhood of water; and Durnford
remarks that it is a useful bird to the traveller in that thirsty country,
as its presence is a sure indication of water. It is resident, and is seen
in small parties of four or five, or in small flocks seldom exceeding
twenty or thirty in number. It feeds and lives on the ground, and
only occasionally is it seen to perch on a low bush. Its flight is strong,
and it flies about a great deal, and usually utters its song when on the
wing. The song is continued all the year, and is heard even on the
coldest days in winter; the notes are few and not highly melodious, but
are cheerful and vigorous.</p>

<p>The nest is made of dry grass and rootlets attached to the rushes in
moist ground, and placed close to or resting on the surface. The eggs
are five, the ground-colour white spotted or blotched with reddish
brown.</p>

<i>Tr. militaris</i>, but rather smaller, and with the under
wing-coverts black.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Northern Argentina and Uruguay.</p>

<p>Throughout the country where this species abounds it is called <i>Pecho
colorado</i>, which is certainly better than Azara&rsquo;s barbarous, if picturesque,
name of <i>Degollado</i>; but no happier name than <i>militaris</i> could have been
invented for it, by which it was formerly known to naturalists; and
though it was given to the bird merely on account of the red breast,
and was therefore equally applicable to all the red-breasted species on
the globe, in this case it accidentally seemed to describe a peculiar habit
of the bird, as well as its bright livery.</p>

<p>In size, form, gait, flight, language, and colour the present bird very
closely resembles the Patagonian Starling; but the crimson on the breast
is brighter and the upper parts are darker. Its nesting-habits are also
like those of the southern bird; the number and colour of the eggs
being the same in both species. One trivial difference in habit is that
De Filippi&rsquo;s Starling occasionally soars up a few yards into the air when
uttering its song. <a name="It" id="It">It</a> inhabits the moist grassy pampas in the southern
part of the Buenos Ayrean province, and is there abundant and unites
in large flocks. At the approach of the cold season there is a general
movement northwards of the birds, which does not, however, extend
far, as the birds, although strong fliers, travel slowly and in a peculiar
manner; it is in this season, when the birds are seen moving in large
flocks, that the name of Military Starling strikes one as being peculiarly
appropriate. They do not journey through the air like other migrants,
but move over the ground, when the flock, composed of four or five
hundred to a thousand or more individuals, is extended so as to present
a very long front, and at intervals the hindmost birds fly over the
others and alight just in advance of them: the long front, the precision
of their movements, and their scarlet bosoms all turned one way, suggest
the idea of a disciplined army on its march.</p>

<p>They never perch on trees, but frequently alight on the roof of a
rancho or other elevation affording a secure footing. They are tame
birds and fly reluctantly; when approached, they usually crouch down,
hiding their crimson bosoms, and remain motionless in order to escape
observation. In disposition they are peaceful, and so fond of society
that when one becomes separated from his fellows he will unite with
birds of another kind, even with Plovers or Tyrant-birds.</p>

<p>On the great monotonous plains, where most of the small birds are
grey- or brown-plumaged, and in winter when there are no flowers to
satisfy the desire of the eye for bright colour, it is delightful, while
travelling, to meet with an army of these Starlings: their crimson<a class="pagenum" name="Page_107" id="Page_107">-&nbsp;107&nbsp;-</a>
bosoms, less bright than the hues of some tropical species, seem then
to glow with a strange splendour on the sombre green of earth, and the
sight produces an exhilarating effect on the mind.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> S. Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia, and Argentina.</p>

<p>This interesting bird, the only <i>Icterus</i> found in the Argentine
Republic, ranges south to Buenos Ayres, where it is migratory, and
appears in small flocks of six or eight individuals in September; but
soon after arriving these little companies break up, and the birds are
subsequently found singly or in pairs in the woods along the Plata
River.</p>

<p>The sexes are alike in colour, but the male is considerably larger;
the whole plumage is an intense black, excepting a rufous spot on the
shoulder, seen only when the bird is on the wing; the bill is black and
curved, the body slender, and the tail long. It is a loquacious bird,
most of its tones being low and pleasing; exceedingly restless in
disposition, incessantly passing from tree to tree, jerking its long tail
and clinging to the branches in various attitudes, while searching for
insects in the decayed bark. While thus engaged it utters a great
variety of chirping and guttural sounds, interspersed with short agreeable
notes. It also has a song of considerable merit, low and varied
in tone, with a peculiar ventriloquism in many of the notes which
produce a confusing idea on the listener that the bird approaches and
recedes alternately whilst uttering them. While singing the bird
continues moving, but always concealed in the thick foliage, and it is
probably this constant turning about of the singer, and the notes
coming through leafy screens of varying density, which makes the
ventriloquism and gives so much light and shade to its mysterious
melody.</p>

<p>The first bird of this species I shot was wounded very slightly in
one wing and fell into a stream; to my very great surprise it began
singing its usual song while floating about on the surface, making no<a class="pagenum" name="Page_108" id="Page_108">-&nbsp;108&nbsp;-</a>
attempt to swim. After fishing it out it continued to sing at intervals
in my hand: how strange it was to hear this bleeding captive bird
warbling out soft, sweet notes which seemed to express only pleasant
emotions! Yet it was evident that the bird was fully alive to its
danger, for it struggled violently to escape and bit my finger savagely
with its sharp beak.</p>

<p>I subsequently found a nest; it was about seven inches deep, composed
entirely of lichens gathered from the boles of trees, ingeniously
woven together and suspended from the small twigs and leaves at the
extremity of a branch. There were no eggs in it, but the birds
fluttered in great trouble about me, and, what greatly surprised me,
uttered a variety of <i>singing</i> notes, unlike their usual song, but many
of them closely resembling the notes of other songsters, which made
me think that this <i>Icterus</i> possesses the mimicking faculty to some
extent. This, however, is a question it would be difficult to decide.
It seems certain, however, that this species is incapable of expressing
any distressing feeling, such as pain, fear, or parental anxiety, with
loud harsh notes like other birds. It is much to be regretted that
Azara, who found this species common in Paraguay, did not pay more
attention to its habits and language, which make it specially interesting
even in a family so rich in strange habits as the <i>Icterid&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> S. Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, Bolivia, and Peru.</p>

<p>The Chopi, which is said to be quite common in Paraguay, is only
found in the north-eastern part of the Argentine Republic, consequently
I have never seen it, except as a cage-bird; nor is there anything about
it in the notes of recent collectors and travellers who have visited the
upper waters of the Plata. This is, however, not to be regretted, since
Azara gave a very full and spirited account of this species in his
&lsquo;Apuntamientos;&rsquo; although it certainly does seem strange that the
Chopi should have had two careful observers of its habits fully a
century ago, namely, Azara and his friend and fellow-naturalist the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_109" id="Page_109">-&nbsp;109&nbsp;-</a>
priest Noseda, and not one since. Evidently Azara was very familiar
with this bird, for he describes it lovingly and at great length, his
history of it being one of the most charming things in his work.
According to him the Chopi is a highly sagacious bird, and although a
frequent visitor to courtyards and verandahs of houses in Paraguay, too
shy and suspicious to be caught with snares. It has a strong and easy
flight, and readily attacks any large bird passing near, following it
persistently in the air, or, pouncing down, fastens itself on its enemy&rsquo;s
back. If the Caracara Eagle (<i>Polyborus</i>) alights in order to shake off
its persecutor, the Chopi perches at a distance of a few feet, where it
assumes an indifferent manner; but no sooner does the Caracara allow
its attention to wander from its adversary, then it is again subjected to
fresh insult. These attacks on so large and powerful a species may be
regarded as mere impertinences, but by practising them the Chopi is
soon able to rid himself of the presence of any unwelcome bird. From
a long distance he recognizes an enemy, by its figure, or even its shadow,
and warns all birds of the coming danger with a loud whistle, which at
once sends them into hiding, while the Chopi goes bravely out to the
encounter; and the result is invariably a victorious song on his part,
beginning with the sound of his own name, and running through a
variety of whistled notes. He also sings well in captivity and when his
mate is incubating; and his voice is first heard welcoming the dawn
from the eaves and tiled roofs of houses where he roosts. The pairing-season
is in November; and, Noseda adds, the breeding-place is a hole
in a bank, or tree-trunks, or in a wall under the eaves, and occasionally
the nest is made in the small branches of an orange or other close-leafed
tree, and is built of sticks and straws carelessly disposed, with a few
feathers for lining. The eggs are four, and white.</p>

<p>It may be added that between Azara and his friend Noseda there was
a great controversy respecting the parasitical habits of the common
Cow-bird (<i>Molothrus</i>), which were first discovered by the former; and
disbelieved in by Noseda, who accounted for the fact that the Cow-bird
is never seen to make a nest by supposing that species to be the year-old
young of the Chopi, which, he further imagined, took three years
to acquire the adult form and plumage. Such an idea might seem to
discredit Noseda as a naturalist, if we did not remember that Gilbert
White at the same period was trying to prove the hybernation of
Swallows in England. The whole of the discussion appears in the
&lsquo;Apuntamientos,&rsquo; under the description of the Chopi; and Noseda is
there allowed to state his own case; after which the better observer,
Azara, gives five objections to the theory, any one of which would be
sufficient to demolish it.</p>

<p>The Tyrannid&aelig; or Tyrant-birds, which play the part of our Flycatchers
in the New World, although they are quite different in structure, contribute
an important element in the Neotropical Avifauna, numbering
as they do more than 350 species. Of these 63 have already been met
with within the limits of the Argentine Republic, and the list, will, no
doubt, be further extended, as many of these birds are small and dull
in colour, and easily hide themselves in the dense forests to which they
resort.</p>

<p>The pampas are the special home of the T&aelig;niopterin&aelig;, or &ldquo;Walking
Tyrants&rdquo; as Swainson called them, which have strong feet and long
tarsi, and frequent open spaces. Amongst them the genera <i>T&aelig;nioptera</i>,
<i>Alectrurus</i>, <i>Cnipolegus</i>, and <i>Lichenops</i> may be regarded as specially
characteristic of the Argentine avifauna. On the other hand, the
Elainein&aelig; and Platyrhynchin&aelig;, which are eminently birds of the dense
forest, are much less numerous within the bounds of Argentina, and
are mostly confined to the wooded districts of the north. The typical
Tyrannin&aelig; form a more mixed group, some species of which, such as
<i>Tyrannus melancholicus</i> and <i>Pyrocephalus rubineus</i>, are prominent
objects in the Argentine ornis.</p>

<p>There is a striking resemblance to a Thrush in this species, when one

it stands or perches, opening and closing its broad tail with a graceful
fan-like motion, the resemblance to the stiff automatic <i>Turdus</i> grows
less, and when it flies vanishes altogether&mdash;its long wings being as
sharply pointed as those of the Peregrine Falcon, while its motions in

the throat pure dark grey, breast and belly rufous, wing-coverts light

comes very near in form, flight, language, and habits, though it has
longer legs and runs more on the ground. Its summer home is in
Southern Patagonia, but its breeding-habits are not known; in winter
it migrates north, and in May is found scattered over the pampas, where
it is usually called by the country people &lsquo;Chorlo,&rsquo; a name for all

<p>These birds are very sociable, going in small flocks, usually of from
half a dozen to twenty individuals; they are restless and active, and
quick and graceful in all their movements, and seek their food on the
ground, chiefly coleopterous insects, on the great level plains they
inhabit. While on the wing they pursue each other playfully in the
air, and also attack and chase passing birds of other kinds, apparently
in a sportive spirit. Occasionally they perch on a thistle-top or low
bush, but never on trees. Their only language is a long, low, plaintive
whistle, heard usually on warm still days in winter.</p>

<p>To this species Azara gives the name of <i>Pepoaz&aacute;</i>, the Guarani for
Barred-wing; and <i>Pepoaza</i> was used by him as a generic name for the
small, well-defined group now placed in the genus <i>T&aelig;nioptera</i>, comprising
eight known species. Most of these birds have some conspicuous
wing-mark. They inhabit the southern portion of the South-American
continent, from South Brazil and Bolivia to the Straits of Magellan,
and are most numerous on the open pampas and in Patagonia. In
size they do not vary greatly, the largest being about nine inches long,
the smallest about seven. In colour they are grey, or, more frequently,
white relieved with black or grey, one species (<i>T. rubetra</i>) being
rufous. Their legs are long, and they run on the ground like <i>Myiotheretes
rufiventris</i>, feeding, to some extent, in the same manner; but they
also occasionally pursue and capture insects on the wing, like the typical
Tyrant-birds that seldom or never alight on the ground. They have
likewise another and unique preying-habit, intermediate between the
Plover-like habits of <i>Agriornis</i>, <i>Myiotheretes</i>, and <i>Muscisaxicola</i>, and the
Swallow- or Flycatcher-like habits of the true Tyrants. The bird perches
itself on an elevation&mdash;the summit of a stalk, or bush, or even of a low
tree&mdash;to watch like a Flycatcher for its insect prey; only instead of
looking about for passing insects, it gazes intently down at the ground,
just as a Kingfisher does at the water, and when it spies a beetle or
grasshopper, darts down upon it, not, however, to snatch it up with the
bill as other Tyrants do, but it first grasps it with its feet, then proceeds
to despatch it, swaying about and opening its wings to keep its own
balance, just as an Owl is seen to do when it grasps a mouse or other
small animal in its claws. After devouring the insect on the spot, it flies
back to its perch to resume the watch. They are very restless, active,
playful birds, and seldom remain long on one spot, apparently finding<a class="pagenum" name="Page_115" id="Page_115">-&nbsp;115&nbsp;-</a>
it irksome to do so; but I have seen the <i>T. irupero</i> occupy the same
perch for hours every day while looking out for insects.</p>

<p>As an English generic name for this small interesting group might be
useful, I would suggest <i>Ground-gazers</i> or <i>Ground-watchers</i>, which
describes the peculiar preying-habit of these birds.</p>

<p>The Pepoaz&aacute; is a swift, active, graceful bird, with a strong, straight
beak, hooked at the point, and a broad tail four inches long, the total
length of the bird being nine inches. The throat and space between the
beak and eye are white; all the rest of the body, also the wing- and tail-coverts,
light grey; tail and wing-quills black, with a pure white band
across the base of the primaries. The tertiaries and rectrices are
tipped with pale rufous grey.</p>

<p>It inhabits Brazil south of the equator, Bolivia and Paraguay, also the
northern provinces of the Argentine Republic. Mr. Barrows gives the
following account of its lively habits in Entrerios:&mdash;&ldquo;They are commonly
seen perched on fences or the tops of bushes or trees in open ground,
frequently making sallies for winged insects, or dropping to the ground
to catch a grasshopper or worm. When shot at while perched and
watching you, they almost invariably leave the perch at the flash,
pitching forward and downward, and usually evading the shot, even at
short range. Several times I have secured them by shooting about a
foot below and two feet in front of them as they sat, but they do not
always fly in this direction. The rapidity of their flight when frightened,
or when quarrelling, is simply astonishing. I have seen one chase
another for three or four minutes, doubling, turning, twisting, and
shooting, now brushing the grass, and now rising to a height of at
least two or three hundred feet, and all the movements so rapid that
the eye could scarcely follow them; and at the end of it each would go
back to the top of his own chosen weed-stalk, apparently without a
feather ruffled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Azara found this species breeding in a hole in a bank; and Mr. Dalgleish
has described a nest, taken from a tree in Uruguay, as a somewhat
slight structure, four inches in diameter, formed of sticks and fibres,
lined with fine grass and a few feathers. It contained three eggs,
pear-shaped, white, with large well-defined spots of reddish brown.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Argentine Republic, Uruguay, and Paraguay.</p>

<p>In this species the sexes are alike. The crown is black and composed
of loose feathers; the forehead, and a broad line over the eye
which extends nearly round the head, also all the under plumage, pure
white; neck and back clear grey; quills black.</p>

<p>This Tyrant is a solitary bird, though often many individuals are found
within call of each other, and they sometimes even unite in a loose flock.
It is found throughout the Argentine country, ranging south to the
Rio Negro, in Patagonia, but abounds most on the Buenos-Ayrean
pampas, where it performs a partial migration. Most of the <i>T&aelig;niopter&aelig;</i>
seek their food by preference on the bare level ground, or where the
vegetation is most scanty. This species varies somewhat in habits, and
seldom runs on the ground, and chiefly inhabits the desert plains,
where the large grasses flourish. On one occasion when I was with
an expedition on the pampas for several weeks, every day a number of
these birds would gather and follow us; perched here and there on
the tall grasses with their bosoms toward us, they often looked at a
distance like large white flowers. Old gauchos have told me that fifty
years ago they were abundant all over the pampas, but have disappeared
wherever the giant grasses have been eaten down, and have given
place to a different vegetation.</p>

<p>Their note is a long, low whistle, the usual language of the <i>T&aelig;niopter&aelig;</i>;
but in this species it is very like a human whistle, on account of
which the bird is named <i>Boyero</i> (ox-driver) on the pampas. One
severe winter great numbers of them appeared in the neighbourhood of
Buenos Ayres, and it was amusing to see the dogs thrown into a great
state of excitement by the low whistling notes heard perpetually from
all sides. Every few moments they would start up and stare about
them to ascertain where the deceptive call came from, and in spite of
many disappointments they would occasionally all rush away, loudly
barking, into the plantation, convinced that some person there was
whistling to call them.</p>

<p>The Black-Crown makes a somewhat shallow nest in a bush or large<a class="pagenum" name="Page_117" id="Page_117">-&nbsp;117&nbsp;-</a>
clump of grass, and lays four white eggs, with large dark red spots,
chiefly at the big end.</p>

<p>I cannot refrain from quoting a passage from Mr. Barrows&rsquo;s paper,
descriptive of the lively temper and habits of this bird:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This species frequently persecutes smaller birds in a way which
seems to imply pure love of mischief. One afternoon in July, when
the river had fallen some feet after an unusual rise, I was walking along
the lines of drift left by the falling water, and watching the different
birds which were picking up insects or other food from the wind-rows.
A score or two of the little chestnut-backed <i>Centrites</i> were running
about, and here and there a <i>T&aelig;nioptera</i> was looking quietly on.
Suddenly I heard a chirp of distress, and looking up saw one of these
small birds apparently making every effort to escape from a <i>T&aelig;nioptera</i>,
which was following in full chase. The two birds were hardly a length
apart and both going at full speed, doubling and dodging in a way that
would have done credit to a bat. The chase lasted perhaps for half a
minute, when the smaller bird alighted, and at once the other also alighted
and began running about unconcernedly and picking up food. But the
instant the smaller one made a start his enemy was at his heels (or
more properly his tail) again, and he was forced to alight. This was
repeated so often that I was on the point of shooting the pursuer, when,
without any notice, he flew quietly off, and resumed his usual
demeanour. It looked like a case of simple spite, for even if there
were twenty other birds about, one seemed to be followed without
regard to the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have often watched <i>T&aelig;niopter&aelig;</i> of different species, also <i>Myiotheretes
rufiventris</i> behaving in a similar way, and agree with Mr.
Barrows that it is &ldquo;an <i>amusement</i> in which the larger bird indulges
simply for the pleasure derived from the exercise of his power.&rdquo;</p>

grey.</p>

<p>It is to some extent migratory, and usually goes in flocks of a dozen
or twenty birds, and frequents open situations where there are bushes
and trees, also plains covered with giant grasses. They are more social
in their habits than <i>T. coronata</i>, but in other respects closely resemble
it, and are exceedingly active lively birds, and when the flock is on

<p>Mr. Barrows observed them in autumn on the Pigu&eacute; (southern

migration, as we did not see them again after leaving this

<p><i>Hab.</i> Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentine Republic, and Bolivia.</p>

<p>This pretty species is found throughout the Argentine country, and is
well known to the natives, and usually called <i>Viudita</i> (Little Widow),
on account of its mourning colours. It is also sometimes curiously
named <i>Anjelito de las Animas</i>, from a superstitious notion due to the
intense whiteness of its plumage and to its supposed habit of frequenting
graveyards. In both sexes the entire plumage is snowy white, except<a class="pagenum" name="Page_119" id="Page_119">-&nbsp;119&nbsp;-</a>
the primaries and the tip of the tail, which are black. In habits it is
more sedentary than other <i>T&aelig;niopter&aelig;</i>, and obtains its food chiefly by
patiently watching the surface of the ground for its insect prey. Its
marvellously white plumage, and the habit of sitting motionless
on the summit of a bush or tree, make it a most conspicuous object,
so that it is strange to find such a bird existing in districts which
abound in raptorial species; for Hawks, I have frequently noticed,
will always single out a white or conspicuously coloured bird for
pursuit, and though the Little Widow, like the other members of its
genus, is swift and strong of wing, the feeble and the young must often
fall victims to their shining white plumage.</p>

<p>The Little Widow is a solitary bird, and not nearly so lively and
playful in manner as <i>T. coronata</i> and <i>T. dominicana</i>, its surpassing
whiteness being its most interesting feature. Its nesting-habits are
unlike those of other <i>T&aelig;niopter&aelig;</i>, for it breeds only in holes, usually in
the bole or branch of a tree; but sometimes it takes possession of the
oven of <i>Furnarius rufus</i> to lay in. The nest is composed chiefly of
feathers and contains four eggs, creamy white, with a few very minute
red spots, irregularly distributed. Mr. Dalgleish says, &ldquo;Some eggs
have only two or three spots, none have more than eight or ten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Barrows says:&mdash;&ldquo;The adults have several of the primaries
remarkably attenuated. Young birds appear to acquire these attenuate
primaries only after a complete moult. But I took one specimen
which showed one or more primaries with tips of ordinary shape but
with a line apparently <i>worn</i> into the vane of the inner web, so as to
mark out distinctly the attenuate tip, and it seemed as if a little more
wearing would cut out a piece which would leave the primary as in
the old bird.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have met with this bird at all seasons of the year in Patagonia on the

in flocks of twenty or thirty individuals, and in its lively actions when
on the wing, and in its habit of perching on a bush or elevation of some
kind, from which it pounces down on an insect seen on the ground, it
resembles other <i>T&aelig;niopter&aelig;</i>; but it runs about on the ground a great
deal, and in this respect is more like a <i>Myiotheretes</i> or <i>Muscisaxicola</i>.
In its colour it also diverges widely from the typical <i>T&aelig;niopteras</i> in
their black and white Dominican plumage. The whole upper parts are
light chestnut, with a white mark on the side of the head; wings and
tail dark, tipped with pale rufous; throat, breast, and belly whitish
rufous, with dark lines on throat and bosom. The chestnut hue in the
female is paler and mixed with grey.</p>

<p>This species generally resembles the one next described, and has, like
it, a black, white, and grey plumage. But the tail, although strange, is
constructed on a different pattern. The total length of the bird is five
and a half inches, the tail being only two and a half. The two outer
tail-feathers have remarkably stout shafts, with broad coarse webs, and<a class="pagenum" name="Page_123" id="Page_123">-&nbsp;123&nbsp;-</a>
look like stumps of two large feathers originally intended for a bigger
bird, and finally cut off near their base and given to a very small one.
In the male these two feathers are carried vertically and at right angles
to the plane of the body, giving the bird a resemblance to a diminutive
cock; hence the vernacular name &lsquo;Gallito,&rsquo; or Little Cock, by which it
is known.</p>

<p>I have not observed this species myself, but Azara has the following
paragraph about its habits:&mdash;&ldquo;The male sometimes rises slowly and
almost vertically, with tail raised, and rapidly beating its wings, and
looking while ascending in this way more like a butterfly than a bird;
and when it has reached a height of ten or twelve yards, it drops
obliquely to the earth and perches on a stalk.&rdquo; He adds that the males
are solitary, but several females are sometimes seen near together, and
that the females are greatly in excess of the males.</p>

denuded, terminated with spatulations on the inner vane.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Hab.</i> S. Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentine Republic.</p>

<p>Azara named this species <i>Cola estra&ntilde;a</i> (Strange-tail), but mentions
incidentally that its Guarani name is &lsquo;guira-yetap&aacute;&rsquo; (Scissor-tail), a
term which the Indians apply indiscriminately to several species having
the same sort of tail.</p>

<p>The Guira-yetap&aacute; is a very curious little bird, with a black, white,
and grey plumage and the beak of a true Tyrant; but it differs from all
its congeners in having the skin of the chin, throat, and sides of the
head bare of feathers, and these parts in the breeding-season are a
bright orange colour. It is a feeble flier, its wings being very short,
while the two outer tail-feathers are abnormally long and peculiar in
form. Mr. Barrows says:<a class="pagenum" name="Page_124" id="Page_124">-&nbsp;124&nbsp;-</a>&mdash;&ldquo;The remarkable condition of the outer
pair of tail-feathers is interesting. In the male these two feathers
reach a length of nearly ten inches, the rest of the tail being about
three inches in length. The vane on the <i>inner</i> side of each is wanting
for the first two inches, and then suddenly develops to a width of
nearly two inches, which it maintains almost to the tip, when it
gradually narrows. The vane on the <i>outer</i> side of the shaft is only
about one-quarter of an inch wide, and is folded so tightly against the
shaft that it is quite inconspicuous. In the only two males of this
species which I have seen flying, these long feathers seemed to be
carried folded together <i>beneath</i> the rest of the tail, and stretching out
behind like a rudder or steering-oar, their vanes at right angles to the
plane of the rest of the tail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Gibson gives a different account, and says the flight is singularly
feeble, resembling the fluttering passage of a butterfly through the air,
while the tail streams out behind.</p>

<p>It inhabits Paraguay, Uruguay, and the eastern portion of the
Argentine Republic, ranging as far south as the pampas in the neighbourhood
of Patagonia. It is usually seen singly or in pairs; Azara
says he saw a flock of thirty individuals, but as they were all <i>females</i>,
it may be that in this species, as in <i>Lichenops perspicillata</i>, the females
are sometimes gregarious, and the males always solitary. It frequents
open places, such as the borders of marshes, or plains covered with tall
grasses, and perches in a conspicuous place, from which it darts at
passing insects like a Flycatcher.</p>

<p>Mr. Gibson found its nest on the ground amongst herbage, and
describes it as a neat structure of dried grass, containing three white
eggs with a faint cream-coloured tinge.</p>

since his brief notice of it in the &lsquo;Apuntamientos&rsquo; nothing concerning
its habits has been recorded. It has a somewhat laboured flight, he
says; lives in pairs or families, frequenting low or marshy grounds,
where it perches on the summit of the reeds or bushes, and flies down
to the ground to capture insects. It also occasionally dashes after
passing insects, taking them on the wing. It has a loud whistle, which
it utters frequently without any variation.</p>

<p>Unfortunately very little is yet known about the habits of these
interesting little Tyrant-birds, for which I should like to suggest the
common name &ldquo;<i>Spectacular</i>,&rdquo; for reasons I shall say more about when I
come to describe the <i>Lichenops perspicillatus</i>, a species which undoubtedly
belongs to this peculiar well-defined group. The plumage of the
male is, in most cases, intensely black, and there is a pure white bar
on the remiges, hidden when the bird is perched, and when it flies
made doubly conspicuous by the peculiar motion of the wings. In all
the known species the female has a dull brown plumage, lined or
mottled with dusky tints, and with some portion of the wing-quills
marked with rufous or chestnut colour.</p>

<p>The Ashy-black Tyrant inhabits the Mendoza district, and is also a
summer visitor in Patagonia, where it was obtained by Dr. D&ouml;ring.
Speaking of its habits, he says the male is solitary, perches on the
summit of a bush or dry twig, emits at intervals a song or call composed
of two syllables, plaintive and flute-like in character, and uttered
while the bird rises up a few feet into the air. During this performance
the white bands on the wings are displayed conspicuously and a
humming sound is produced.</p>

<p>This species is found in the western provinces of the Argentine
Republic, and, like <i>C. anthracinus</i>, which it closely resembles, is a
summer visitor in Patagonia, where it makes its appearance in October.
The plumage is intense black, with the inner webs of the remiges at
their base white, but the wing-band, which is over an inch in breadth,
shows only when the bird flies. There is also a small white spot on
the flank, scarcely visible, and excepting for this speck the bird at rest
appears entirely black. When it flies the white band appears suddenly,
producing a curious effect, for the wings are opened and shut successively
and with great rapidity, making the white band appear like a
succession of flashes. All the movements of the bird are eccentric to a
degree. It selects a dead twig on the summit of a bush, and this perch
it occupies during many hours every day. Occasionally it darts after
a passing insect, but I believe it feeds principally on the ground,
like <i>Lichenops perspicillatus</i>. At intervals it quits its perch very
suddenly and revolves round it with the rapidity of a moth whirling
round the flame of a candle, the wings producing a loud humming
sound, and the bird uttering a series of sharp clicking notes. During
this performance the white wing-band appears like a pale mist surrounding
the bird. This fantastical dance over, it resumes its perch,
and, until moved to a second display, sits as motionless as a bird carved
out of jet.</p>

<p>Naturalists have said a great deal about the well-known Silver-bill
(the most important member of my &ldquo;<i>Spectacular</i>&rdquo; group), the question
as to whether the black and red birds are sexes or two distinct species
having long remained unsettled. Azara, writing in the last century,
under the heading <i>Pico de Plata</i>, rightly described the red bird as the
female of the black; but, unfortunately, in another part of his work he
described the female again as a different species, naming it <i>Suiriri
chorreado</i>. Darwin also separated the sexes, and gave the name of
<i>Lichenops erythropterus</i> to the red-plumaged bird. The following extract
gives only a portion of his argument, and is interesting to read, even
now, when the question has been finally set at rest, as it shows how
much the two birds differ:&mdash;&ldquo;The tail of <i>L. erythropterus</i> is squarer
and contains only ten feathers instead of twelve: the wing is <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> of
an inch shorter; and the secondaries relative to the primaries are also
shorter. The red colour on the primaries represents but does not
correspond with the white on the black feathers of <i>L. perspicillatus</i>;
and the secondaries in the two birds are quite differently marked. In
<i>L. erythropterus</i> the third, fourth, and fifth primaries are the longest,
and are equal to each other; the second is only a little shorter than the
third. In <i>L. perspicillatus</i> the third is rather shorter than the fourth
and fifth; and the second is proportionately shorter relative to the
third, so that the outer part of the wing in this species is more pointed
than in <i>L. erythropterus</i>. The outer claw in the latter species is only
in a small degree straighter than in the former; and this, considering
that <i>L. perspicillatus</i> is generally perched, and when on the ground can
only hop, and that <i>L. erythropterus</i> feeds there entirely, and walks, is
very remarkable.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_130" id="Page_130">-&nbsp;130&nbsp;-</a>When
one considers the habits of the two birds, even where they
are most abundant and seen continually, it is indeed difficult to believe
that they are of the same species. They are never seen associating
together, even in the love-season, and when I have watched a pair
actually engaged in constructing their nest, they appeared to keep as
far apart as possible. More than that, the male, while unfriendly
towards all other species, appears to cherish a special antipathy against
the red bird; and when one comes near him never fails to pursue it
with the greatest virulence from the neighbourhood. He is also strictly
solitary, but the red birds frequently unite in small parties, especially in
autumn, when I have often seen as many as a dozen together.</p>

<p>Altogether the Silver-bill has been a puzzle in the past, and it would
now appear, from some recent observations made by Mr. Barrows,
that we have not yet got to the end of all the curious points in its
habits. Without doubt it is migratory. Its range extends from
Paraguay to Patagonia, where it is not common. In Paraguay and the
hotter parts of the Argentine country it is probably stationary; in
Buenos Ayres, where it is most abundant, many individuals remain all
the year in sheltered places, and the migration appears to become more
definite the further south we get. Mr. Barrows travelled south across
the pampas in the autumn, and says:&mdash;&ldquo;The species was met with at
all points visited, but south of the Azul not a single male in the black
plumage was seen, though the brown birds (presumably females or
young) were met with almost every day for nine weeks, and frequently
in large numbers. Of course I began to suspect that the males must
moult into a brown suit after nesting, as do our Bobolinks and many
other birds, but I shot specimens at various times, and all proved to be
either females or young males, and as I was confident that at Concepcion
black males were to be found through the year, I was at a loss
for an explanation, and am so still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The male Silver-bill is entirely black, there is nothing in nature
blacker than its plumage; and, to enhance the effect, the beak is of a
very delicate primrose-yellow, which at a little distance appears white,
hence the vernacular name. The eye, and broad free skin surrounding it,
which is ruffed like an Elizabethan collar, are of the same faint primrose
hue. The secondary wing-quills are pure white, but the white is only
displayed when the bird flies. The female has the naked skin encircling
the eye, but its colour, as also that of the beak, is much darker than in
the male. Entire upper plumage dark brown; secondaries chestnut;
lower parts fawn-colour, marked with brown. The young males are at
first like the females in colour, and do not acquire the black plumage
until the end of the summer.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_131" id="Page_131">-&nbsp;131&nbsp;-</a>The
bird ranges over the whole of the Argentine Republic, and,
according to Gay, is also common throughout Chili, where it is known
as the <i>Colegial</i> (Collegian or learned person), on account of its stiff
grave manner, black dress, and spectacled appearance.</p>

<p>The male is a solitary bird, and feeds chiefly on the ground, running
rapidly about in open places like a <i>Muscisaxicola</i>. It is also frequently
seen perched conspicuously on the summit of a tall stalk or bush, and
occasionally making a dart into the air after passing insects, showing in
this habit his relationship with the Tyrant-birds. But he perches on
an elevation less to watch for insects than for the purpose of his curious
spectacular performance. This highly eccentric habit is strikingly like
that of <i>Cnipolegus hudsoni</i>; and I have no doubt that all the <i>Cnipolegi</i>
possess similar habits. Both birds perch on a conspicuous place,
upright, motionless, and looking more like grotesque little automata
than living things; they both also leave the perch suddenly, as if shot
from it by means of a steel spring. This singularly sudden movement,
and the motion of the wings, rapid as in the Humming-bird, or shut
and opened alternately and exhibiting the white wing-colour in a series
of flashes, seems related to the conspicuous white mark. In both
species, also, the wings make a humming sound during flight. The
motions of the Silver-bill are, however, in some respects different from
those of the <i>Cnipolegus</i>. Springing from its perch at intervals, it darts
vertically to a height of about fifteen yards, then turns a summersault,
uttering at the same moment a shrill-sounding little cry, after which it
drops down again and alights on its perch suddenly, as if jerked back
to it, and there remains stiff, erect, and motionless as before.</p>

<p>The nest is made of dry grass in a thistle-bush or clump of reeds, and
is rather deep and cup-shaped. The eggs are four in number, white,
and spotted at the larger end with dark red.</p>

Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and La Plata.</p>

<p>This species, found in the open districts throughout South America,
from Venezuela to Buenos Ayres, where it is quite common, has very
interesting habits. It is seven inches and a half long, has a plump
body, short wings, and long legs. The upper plumage is light brown,
the throat, breast, and belly yellow, and the male has a concealed crest
of a bright orange-red colour.</p>

<p>It resembles the true Tyrants in disposition, in its shrill piercing
language, and in the habit of perching and breeding in trees. On the
other hand, like the long-legged <i>Myiotheretes</i>, that lives on the open
plains, it feeds exclusively on the ground, over which it runs with a
speed possessed by few perching species. The general impression one
forms is that in manners and appearance the Short-winged Tyrant is
quite unlike any other species, though all its habits are to be found in
one or other of the various groups comprising the <i>Tyrannid&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>These birds have no migration, but pair for life, and always remain
on the same spot, and will continue to breed in the same hole for many
years, even where they are frequently deprived of their eggs. Azara saw
them sometimes uniting in small flocks in Paraguay; in Buenos Ayres
they are always seen in pairs, or, after the young have left the nest, in
families. They prefer to live near a human habitation, where there are
trees: even one tree, in which they can breed and find shelter at night,
will be sufficient to attach them to a dwelling, so great is their partiality
for the clean-trodden ground where they can freely run about and catch
insects. They haunt the cattle-pens, and become extremely familiar
with the cows, horses, and sheep, following them to the pasture-grounds,
where they are often seen perched on the back of a horse or other
domestic animal, or stationed close to its nose on the ground, watching
for insects. On the bare ground they run about with wonderful swiftness,
and are able to overtake and capture flying insects without rising.
The male and female invariably hunt together, and at intervals fly to
some favourite perch to indulge in a duet composed of loud, rapid, shrill
notes, somewhat metallic in sound. Though able to fly swiftly when
in pursuit of a passing hawk or other bird, at other times their flight is
strangely slow; the round body, short blunt wings and tail giving the
bird a somewhat curious appearance as it progresses laboriously through
the air. I have frequently seen them make the most unprovoked
assaults on birds of an inoffensive kind; possibly they are in these
attacks moved by a playful rather than by a vindictive spirit. I once saw
one drop like a stone from a height of fifty yards on to a Pigeon
perched on a leafless tree. The Pigeon fell as if shot to the earth; the
Tyrant-bird then released his hold; the Pigeon rushed away terrified<a class="pagenum" name="Page_133" id="Page_133">-&nbsp;133&nbsp;-</a>
through the trees, while its persecutor rose high up in the air and
resumed its journey.</p>

<p>I have elsewhere spoken of the wars waged by this bird against other
species, all seeking to gain possession of the large nest of <i>Anumbius
acuticaudatus</i>. A hole in the trunk of a tree is also a favourite breeding-place.
The nest is neatly built of slender twigs and leaves, and lined
with horse-hair. The eggs are slightly oval, and densely marked with
dark brown spots or stripes on a white or brownish-white ground.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Peru, Bolivia, Chili, Patagonia, and Falkland Islands.</p>

<p>This South-Patagonian species is one of a Chilian group of Tyrant-birds
which resemble in their habits the <i>Saxicol&aelig;</i> of Europe. The
plumage is generally grey, with more or less rufous colour on the crown;
they have long legs, and run swiftly on the ground, frequent open sterile
situations, and perch only occasionally on trees.</p>

<p>The present bird is about seven inches long; the upper parts are dull
grey, except the crown, which is dark chestnut; under surface light
grey, and tail nearly black. In the month of June I met with these
birds on the Rio Negro, on their arrival there from the south. They
went in flocks of a dozen or twenty birds; they had a swift easy flight,
were shy and restless in their manner, and uttered low plaintive
whistling notes. When a flock alights on the ground the birds all
instantly scatter, running rapidly about in all directions over the bare
ground. Occasionally one was seen to perch on some slight elevation,
and dart like a Flycatcher after passing insects.</p>

<p>Darwin saw this bird as far north on the Atlantic coast as Bahia
Blanca. He also found it at Tierra del Fuego, where it lives entirely
on the sea-beaches; and in the sterile upper valleys of the Chilian
Andes, at a height of ten thousand feet, where the last traces of vegetation
occur and where no other bird lives.</p>

<p>The little Red-backed Tyrant comes nearest to <i>Muscisaxicola mentalis</i>
in habits, but does not perch on bushes and trees, and is less gregarious<a class="pagenum" name="Page_135" id="Page_135">-&nbsp;135&nbsp;-</a>
than that bird. It is the smallest of all those varied members of the
<i>Tyrannine</i> family which have abandoned forests and marshes and the
pursuit of insects on the wing, to live on the wintry uplands of Patagonia,
and on the sterile plains bordering on the Andes.</p>

<p>The male is only five and a quarter inches long. The entire plumage
of the male is intensely black, except the back, which is bright chestnut.
The inside of the mouth and tongue are vivid orange-yellow.
The chestnut colour on the female is pale, the rest of the plumage grey,
except the quills, which are dark.</p>

<p>Its summer home is in the southern portion of Patagonia, but its
nesting-habits are not known. In March it migrates north, and is very
common everywhere on the pampas throughout the winter. They arrive
in small parties of three or four, or in little loose flocks of about a
dozen individuals, travelling with a swift low flight. Males, females,
and young, grey like the last, arrive together; shortly after arriving the
young males become mottled with black, and before leaving acquire
the adult plumage. They appear to leave in spring all together, but
from a note by Durnford it would appear that the males travel in
advance of the females. He says:&mdash;&ldquo;Males of this species were
common at Chupat throughout September and during the first few days
of October. On the 5th of the latter month I observed the first females,
which gradually increased in number.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Little Red-backs inhabit open unsheltered plains, and have so
great a predilection for bare ground on which they can run freely about,
that on their arrival on the pampas, where the earth is thickly carpeted
with grass, they are seen attaching themselves to roads, sheep-pens,
borders of streams, vizcacha villages, and similar places. They are exceedingly
restless, running swiftly over the ground, occasionally darting
into the air in pursuit of small flies, and all the flock so scattered that
there will be a dozen yards between every two birds. Mr. Barrows
describes their lively habits very well:&mdash;&ldquo;I think this is one of the most
restless birds I ever saw. You cannot depend upon him to be in the
same place two consecutive half-seconds. He runs like a Sanderling,
and whenever he keeps his feet still by accident, his wings are flirted in
a way that shows his anxiety to be off. Several are usually found
together, and sometimes a loose flock of a hundred or more is seen.
They are very strong on the wing, sometimes mounting rapidly for
several hundred feet, if suddenly startled, and after a few moments
spent in circling like a Snipe, they drop again almost as suddenly as a
shot, and as if from the very clouds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This little bird is rarely met with in the desert pampas, but throughout
the settled portion of the Buenos-Ayrean province it is one of the
most common species of the <i>Tyrannid&aelig;</i>. It arrives from the north
in September, and is very regular in its migrations, although apparently
a very feeble flier. It frequents open grounds abounding in thistles,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_138" id="Page_138">-&nbsp;138&nbsp;-</a>
tall weeds, or bushes, and is consequently most abundant about houses.
It is extremely active, and occasionally darts after a passing insect
and captures it on the wing, especially soft insects, like moths and
butterflies, to which it is most partial. It subsists principally, however,
on small caterpillars and spiders, for which it searches diligently
among the leaves, after the manner of the Wren. Although belonging
to the songless division of the Passeres, this small Tyrant-bird possesses
a formal song, which the male utters with great frequency, the only
other member of the Tyrant-family that I am acquainted with which
really sings being the Scarlet Tyrant (<i>Pyrocephalus rubescens</i>). The
music of the Reed-Tyrant is weak but curious; it is composed of
five brief percussive notes, distinctly metallic in sound, which may be
imitated by gently and slowly striking <i>fa la mi sol fa</i> on the highest
keys of the piano. To utter this quaint little song the bird perches
itself on the summit of a weed or bush, where it solicits attention with
a little chipping prelude, and then jerks its head vigorously with each
note, delivering its few drops of sound with all the assurance of a
master in the art of melody.</p>

<p>In October it builds a deep elaborate nest of fine dry grass, thistle-down,
webs, feathers, and other soft materials, usually in the fork of a
weed or thistle three or four feet from the ground. It lays four
cream-coloured eggs, the colour deepening to grey at the larger end.</p>

does not appear to be migratory, for on the Rio Negro I found it at
all seasons. It is slender in form, with a long tail, its total length
being six inches. The sexes are alike in colour; the upper parts are
yellowish grey, breast and belly light yellow. They are found living
in pairs, all the year round, in thorn bushes, and are scarcely ever seen
to rest, but hop incessantly from twig to twig, in a delicate, leisurely
manner, seeking on the leaves for the minute caterpillars and other
insects on which they live. While thus engaged they utter a variety of
little chirping and twittering notes, as if conversing together, and
occasionally the two birds unite their voices in a shrill, impetuous song.</p>

<p>This species is one of the smallest members of our <i>Tyrannid&aelig;</i>, its
total length being only four and a half inches. The sexes are alike;
the upper plumage is grey, with a greenish tinge on the back; the
breast paler grey, becoming pale yellow on the belly. There is a white
concealed spot under the loose feathers of the crown.</p>

<p>It is quite common in Buenos Ayres, and, probably, has a partial
migration, as it is most abundant in summer. In its habits it closely
resembles the species last described, being always found in pairs,
living in thickets, where they hop incessantly about, exploring the
leaves for small caterpillars, and always conversing in low, chirping,
and twittering notes. They also sing together a little confused song.
The nest is fastened to the slender twigs of a low bush, and is a deep,
cup-shaped and beautiful structure, composed of a great variety of soft
materials bound together with spiders&rsquo; webs, the interior lined with
feathers or vegetable down, and the outside with lichen. The eggs are
two, bluntly pointed, and of a cream-colour.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> S.E. Brazil, Paraguay, La Plata, and N. Patagonia.</p>

<p>This species differs markedly in habits, language, and appearance
from the last. In both sexes the colour is a uniform slaty grey; the
tail, which the bird incessantly opens and flirts like a fan, is black; as
in <i>S. subcristata</i> there is a hidden spot of white under the loose
feathers forming the crest.</p>

<p>It frequents the borders of running streams, seldom being found
far from a water-course; and it alights as often on stones or on the
bare ground as on trees. Male and female are always seen together,
for it pairs for life, and the migration, if it has any, is only partial.
It flits restlessly along the borders of the stream it frequents, making
repeated excursions after small winged insects, taking them in the air,
or snatching them up from the surface of the water, and frequently
returning to the same stand. While thus employed it perpetually
utters a loud, complaining <i>chuck</i>, and at intervals the two birds meet,
and, with crests erect and flirting their wings and tails, utter a series of
trills and hurried sharp notes in concert.</p>

<p>The nest is generally placed beneath an overhanging bank, attached
to hanging roots or grass, a few inches above the water; but it is sometimes
placed in a bush growing on the borders of a stream. It is a
neat, cup-shaped, but rather shallow structure, thickly lined inside with
feathers. The eggs are four, pointed, white or pale cream-colour, with
black and grey spots at the large end.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> La Plata, Chili, and Western Peru.</p>

<p>This charming little bird is variously called by the country people
All-coloured or Seven-coloured. Azara called it &ldquo;The King&rdquo;&mdash;a name
which this species deserves, he says, not only on account of the crown
of loose feathers on its head, but because it is exceeded by few birds in
beauty. It is the most beautiful bird found in Chili, says Gay; and
Darwin, who is seldom moved to express admiration, calls it &ldquo;an
exquisitely beautiful little bird.&rdquo; There are many species possessing
a more brilliant plumage, none with so great a variety of distinct
colours; for on its minute body, which is less than that of the House-Wren,
are seen black, white, green, blue, orange, yellow, and scarlet;
and all these hues are disposed and contrasted in such a manner as to
produce a very pleasing effect&mdash;the olive-green and delicate, yellow
predominating, while the vivid scarlet is a mere spot, like the bright
gem or ornament which serves to set off and enhance the beauty of the
dress. The whole under plumage is pure lovely yellow, while a broad
mark of velvet-black extends belt-wise from the bend of each wing,
but without meeting in the centre of the bosom. The sides of the head
are deep blue; over the blue runs a bright yellow stripe, surmounted
with the loose, slender, almost hair-like feathers of the crown, which
stand partially erect, and are blue mixed with black, with vivid scarlet
in the centre. Above, from the back of the head to the tail, the colour
is deep green. The wings are black, crossed with a white band; tail
also black, the two outer quills pure white, and the succeeding two
partially white, the white colour appearing only when the bird flies.
Moreover, as though this diversity of colour were not enough, the soles
of the black feet are bright orange, the eye of the male delicate sky-blue,
while the female has white eyes.</p>

<p>While on the subject of the colouring of this species, I will mention
a curious phenomenon which I have observed many times. When the
bird is flying away from the spectator in a strong sunlight, and is at a
distance of from twenty to thirty yards from him, the upper plumage,
which is dark green, sometimes appears bright blue. At first I thought
that a distinct species of <i>Cyanotis</i>, cerulean blue in colour, existed, but<a class="pagenum" name="Page_144" id="Page_144">-&nbsp;144&nbsp;-</a>
finally became convinced that the green feathers of the <i>C. azar&aelig;</i>
appear blue in certain lights. This seems strange, as the feathers of
the back are not glossed.</p>

<p>The Many-coloured Tyrant is, apparently, a very feeble flier, rising
reluctantly when frightened from the rushes, and fluttering away to a
distance of a few yards, when it again drops down. Yet it is strictly
migratory. Darwin met with it at Maldonado in the month of June,
and therefore concluded that it does not migrate; but he mentions that
it was very rare. I have also occasionally seen one in winter on the
pampas, but many migratory species leave a few stragglers behind in the
same way. At the end of September they suddenly appear all over
the pampas, in every swamp and stream where there are beds of rushes;
for in such situations only is the bird found: and this migration extends
far into Patagonia. They are always seen in pairs amongst the dense
rushes, where they perch on the smooth stems, not near the summit,
but close down to the surface of the water, and perpetually hop from
stem to stem, deftly picking up small insects from the surface of the
water. They also occasionally leave the rushes and search for insects
in the grass and herbage along the border. They are very inquisitive,
and if a person approach the rush-bed, they immediately come out of
their concealment, both birds uttering their singular notes&mdash;a silvery,
modulated sound, not meant for a song apparently, and yet I do not
know any sweeter, purer sound in nature than this. All through the
close-growing dark rushes the pretty little melodists may be heard
calling to each other in their delicate, gurgling notes.</p>

<p>The nest is a marvel of skill and beauty. As a rule it is attached to
a single polished rush, two or three feet above the water and about the
middle of the stem. It is cup-shaped inside, and about four inches
long, circular at the top, but compressed at the lower extremity, and
ending in a sharp point. It is composed entirely of soft bits of dry
yellow rush, cemented together with gum so smoothly that it looks as
if made in a mould. The eggs are two in number, oval, and dull
creamy white, sometimes with a ring of colour at the large end.</p>

Bienteveo is in its habits the most interesting member of the
Tyrannine family. It would be difficult to find two species more
dissimilar in disposition than are the Silver-bill, already described, and
the Bienteveo; the former being like an automaton, having only a few set
motions, gestures, and instincts, while the other is versatile in an
extraordinary degree, and seems to have studied to advantage the
various habits of the Kestrel, Flycatcher, Kingfisher, Vulture, and fruit-eating
Thrush; and when its weapons prove weak it supplements
them with its running. How strange it is that these two species,
mentally as widely separated as the Humming-bird and Crow, should

length being nine and a half inches, including the beak, which is a
little over an inch in length. The wings are blunt and comparatively
short, measuring, when spread, fourteen inches. The head is large,
and a broad, black band extends from the beak its entire length, and
above this is a pure white stripe; the crown is black, concealing in its
loose, abundant feathers a brilliant yellow crest, which shows only
when the bird is excited. The upper plumage, including wings and tail,
is pale brown; the entire under surface sulphur-yellow. In both sexes
the plumage is alike.</p>

<p>In Buenos Ayres the Bienteveo is found in every orchard and
plantation: it is familiar with man and invariably greets his approach
with loud notes&mdash;especially with a powerful three-syllabled cry, in
which people fancy there is a resemblance to the words Bien-te-veo
(&ldquo;I see you well&rdquo;); while its big head and beak, and strongly contrasted
colours, especially the black and white head-stripes, seem to give it a
wonderfully knowing look, as it turns its head from side to side to
examine the intruder. It is a loud-voiced garrulous bird, and has a
great range of sounds, from grating screams to long, clear, almost
mellow call-notes. It has one pretty habit, which brings out strongly
the pleasant feature in its character. Though the male and female are
greatly attached, they do not go afield to hunt in company, like the
Short-winged Tyrant, but separate to meet again at intervals during
the day. One of a couple (say the female) returns to the trees where
they are accustomed to meet, and after a time, becoming impatient or
anxious at the delay of her consort, utters a very long, clear call-note.
He is perhaps a quarter of a mile away, watching for a frog beside
a pool, or beating, harrier-like, over a thistle-bed, but he hears the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_149" id="Page_149">-&nbsp;149&nbsp;-</a>
note and presently responds with one of equal power. Then, perhaps,
for half an hour, at intervals of half a minute, the birds answer each
other, though the powerful call of the one must interfere with his
hunting. At length he returns; then the two birds, perched close
together, with their yellow bosoms almost touching, crests elevated,
and beating the branch with their wings, scream their loudest notes in
concert&mdash;a confused jubilant noise that rings through the whole
plantation. Their joy at meeting is patent, and their action corresponds
to the warm embrace of a loving human couple.</p>

<p>I have frequently stood for the space of half an hour concealed
amongst the trees where a Bienteveo was calling to her mate, cheered
at intervals by the far-off faint response, for the pleasure of witnessing
in the end the joyful reunion of the two birds.</p>

<p>Except when breeding the Bienteveo is a peaceful bird, never going out
of its way to make gratuitous attacks on individuals of its own or of other
species; but in the pursuit of its prey it is cunning, bold, and fierce.
Like the true Tyrant-birds it preys a great deal on large insects when
they are abundant in the warm season, and is frequently seen catching
its prey in the air. A large beetle or grasshopper it invariably beats
against a branch before devouring it. But even in summer, when
insect prey is most abundant, it prefers a more substantial diet whenever
such is to be had. It frequently carries off the fledglings of the
smaller birds from their nests, in the face of the brave defence often
made by the parents. It is also fond of fishing, and may be seen
perched by the hour on a bank or overhanging branch beside a stream,
watching the water like a Kingfisher, and at intervals dashing down to
capture the small fry. In shallow pools, where there are tadpoles and
other prey, the Bienteveo does not mind getting a little wet, but
alights in the water and stands belly-deep watching for its prey. I
have seen a Bienteveo standing in the water in the midst of a flock of
Glossy Ibises. They are often seen, as Darwin remarks, hovering like
a Kestrel over the grass, and then dashing down to seize their prey.
Small snakes, frogs, mice, and lizards all minister to its appetite, and
with a capture of this kind it invariably flies to the nearest stone or
branch, against which it beats the life of its victim out before devouring
it. I once saw one fly out of some weeds carrying a little wriggling
snake of a very brittle species and about eight inches long in its beak.
Alighting on a gate it proceeded to kill its capture, and at the first
blow on the wood the snake flew into two pieces. A mouse gives it a
great deal of trouble, for after it has been killed it cannot be devoured
until reduced by repeated blows to a soft pulp, after which it is with
great labour pulled to pieces and eaten. Snails and <i>Ampullari&aelig;</i> are<a class="pagenum" name="Page_150" id="Page_150">-&nbsp;150&nbsp;-</a>
also pounded until the shell breaks. In spring they sometimes join
the train of hooded gulls, guira cuckoos, cow-birds, and various other
kinds which follow the plough to pick up worms and larv&aelig;; but on
the ground the Bienteveo is awkward in its motions, for it cannot run
like the Tyrant-birds with terrestrial habits, but only hops. At
estancia houses, when a cow is slaughtered, it comes in with the fowls,
milvago hawks, and dogs, for small pickings, being very fond of fresh
meat. It is a common thing to see a Bienteveo following a rural
butcher&rsquo;s cart, and waiting for an opportunity to dash in and carry off
any small piece of meat or fat it is able to detach. In the autumn
they feed very much on ripe fruit, preferring grapes, which they can
swallow whole, and figs, which are soft and easily eaten.</p>

<p>In its nidification the Bienteveo also departs widely from the, so to
speak, traditional habits of its congeners; for whereas most Tyrants
make small shallow nests, this species makes a very big elaborate domed
structure, and sometimes takes five or six weeks to complete it. It is
placed in a tree, without any attempt at concealment, and is about a
foot deep and eight or nine inches broad, and composed of a variety of
soft materials, chiefly wool. The entrance is placed near the top.
Outside, the nest has a very disorderly appearance, as there are always
long straws and sometimes rags hanging down; the cavity is deeply
lined with feathers, and is the <i>hottest</i> nest I know. The eggs are five,
very long, pointed, cream-coloured, and spotted, chiefly at the large
end, with chocolate and purple.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> S. America, from Colombia down to Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>It is in vain, I think, to attempt to make more than one species out
of this widely-spread bird, though specimens from the west coast are
usually smaller.</p>

<p>The Scarlet Tyrant is about five inches and a half long; the neck,
back, wings, and tail are black, all the rest of the plumage the most
vivid scarlet imaginable. The loose feathers of the crown, which form
a crest, are especially brilliant, and seem to glow like a live coal amidst
the green foliage. Beside this bright Tyrant-bird even the Rainbow
Tanagers look pale, and the &ldquo;Jewel Humming-birds&rdquo; decidedly sad-coloured.
It is not strange, therefore, that in South America, where it
has a very wide range, it is a species well known to the country people,
and that they have bestowed on it many pretty names, most of which
have reference to its splendid scarlet colour. In the Argentine Republic
it is usually called <i>Churinche</i>, from its note, also <i>Feder&aacute;l</i> and <i>Fueg&eacute;ro</i>;
in other countries <i>Sangre de Toro</i> (bull&rsquo;s blood), and, better still, <i>Sangre</i><a class="pagenum" name="Page_153" id="Page_153">-&nbsp;153&nbsp;-</a>
<i>Pura</i>. Little Soldier and Coal of Fire are also amongst its names.
The Guarani tribes call it <i>Guira-pit&aacute;</i> (red-bird); but another Indian
name, mentioned by d&rsquo;Orbigny, is the best&mdash;<i>Quarhi-rahi</i>, which signifies
Sun-born.</p>

<p>The Churinche appears in Buenos Ayres about the end of September,
and is usually first seen in localities to which Tyrant-birds are partial,
such as low grassy grounds, with here and there a stalk or bush, and
near a wood or plantation. Insects are most abundant in such places;
and here the Churinche is seen, perched on a twig, darting at intervals to
snap at the flies after the fashion of the Flycatchers, and frequently uttering
its low, plaintive note. It is very common in the woods along the
Plata; every orchard on the pampas is visited by a few of them; and
they are very abundant about Buenos Ayres city. Going south they
become rarer; but, strange to say, a few individuals find their way to
the shores of the Rio Negro, though before reaching it they must cross
a high, barren country quite unsuited to them. The natives of the
Carmen have no name for the Churinche, but speak of it as a bird
wonderful for its beauty and seldom seen. Amongst the dull-plumaged
Patagonian species it certainly has a very brilliant appearance.</p>

<p>A very few days after their arrival the Churinches pair; and the male
selects a spot for the nest&mdash;a fork in a tree from six to twelve feet from
the ground, or sometimes a horizontal bough. This spot the male
visits about once a minute, sits on it with his splendid crest elevated,
tail spread out, and wings incessantly fluttering, while he pours out a
continuous stream of silvery gurgling notes, so low they can scarcely be
heard ten paces off, and somewhat resembling the sound of water
running from a narrow-necked flask, but infinitely more rapid and
musical. Of the little bird&rsquo;s homely, grey, silent mate the observer will
scarcely obtain a glimpse, she appearing as yet to take little or no
interest in the affairs that so much occupy the attention of her consort,
and keep him in a state of such violent excitement. He is exceedingly
pugnacious, so that when not fluttering on the site of his future nest,
or snapping up some insect on the wing, he is eagerly pursuing other
male Churinches, apparently bachelors, from tree to tree. At intervals
he repeats his remarkable little song, composed of a succession of
sweetly modulated metallic trills uttered on the wing. The bird usually
mounts upwards from thirty to forty yards, and, with wings very much
raised and rapidly vibrating, rises and drops almost perpendicularly half
a yard&rsquo;s space five or six times, appearing to keep time to his notes in
these motions. This song he frequently utters in the night, but without
leaving his perch; and it then has a most pleasing effect, as it is
less hurried, and the notes seem softer and more prolonged than when<a class="pagenum" name="Page_154" id="Page_154">-&nbsp;154&nbsp;-</a>
uttered by day. About a week after the birds have arrived, when the
trees are only beginning to display their tender leaves, the nest is commenced.
Strange to say, the female is the sole builder; for she now
lays by her indifferent mien, and the art and industry she displays more
than compensate for the absence of those beauties and accomplishments
that make her mate so pleasing to the sight and ear. The materials of
which the nest is composed are almost all gathered on trees; they are
lichens, webs, and thistle-down: and the dexterity and rapidity with
which they are gathered, the skill with which she disposes them, the
tireless industry of the little bird, who visits her nest a hundred times
an hour with invisible webs in her bill, are truly interesting to the
observer. The lichens firmly held together with webs, and smoothly
disposed with the tops outside, give to the nest the colour of the bark
it is built on.</p>

<p>After the Churinche&rsquo;s nest is completed, the Bienteveo (<i>Pitangus
bolivianus</i>) and the Common Cow-bird (<i>Molothrus bonariensis</i>) are the
troublers of its peace. The first of these sometimes carries off the
nest bodily to use it as material in building its own; the female Cow-bird
is ever on the look out for a receptacle for her eggs. Seldom,
however, does she succeed in gaining admittance to the Churinche&rsquo;s
nest, as he is extremely vigilant and violent in repelling intruders.
But his vigilance at times avails not; the subtle bird has watched and
waited till, seizing a moment when the little Scarlet Tyrant is off
his guard, she drops her surreptitious egg into his nest. When this
happens, the Churinches immediately leave their nest. The nest is
sometimes lined with feathers, but usually with thistle-down; the eggs
are four, pointed, and spotted at the broad end with black; usually
each egg has also a few large grey spots. The young are at first grey,
marked with pale rufous, but soon become entirely grey, like the
female. In about a month&rsquo;s time the belly of the males begins to
assume a pale mauve-red; this spreads upwards towards the breast and
throat; and finally the crest also takes on this colour. The Churinches
raise two broods in a season&mdash;but if the nest is destroyed, will lay as
many as four times.</p>

<p>The Scarlet Tyrant is the first of our summer visitors to leave us. As
early as the end of January, and so soon as the young of the second
brood are able to feed themselves, the adults disappear. Their going is
not gradual, but they all vanish at once. The departure of all other
migratory species takes place after a very sensible change in the temperature;
but at the end of January the heat is unmitigated&mdash;it is, in
fact, often greater than during December.</p>

<p>When the adults have gone, the silent young birds remain. Within<a class="pagenum" name="Page_155" id="Page_155">-&nbsp;155&nbsp;-</a>
a month&rsquo;s time the sexes of these may be distinguished. After another
month the males begin to sing, and are frequently seen pursuing one
another over the fields. It is only at the end of April, three months after
the old birds have disappeared, that the young also take their departure.
This is one of the strangest facts I have encountered in the migration
of birds. The autumnal cold and wet weather seems to be the immediate
cause of the young birds&rsquo; departure; but in the adults, migration
appears to be an instinct quite independent of atmospheric changes.</p>

<p>Alcide d&rsquo;Orbigny met with this fine species in Corrientes, and Dr.
Burmeister in Entrerios, and again near Mendoza. In the neighbourhood
of Concepcion Mr. Barrows speaks of it as a &ldquo;not very abundant
summer resident, but one not easily overlooked, owing to its habit of
perching on the topmost twig of any tree on which it alights, making
forays from time to time, when tempted by its winged prey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the vicinity of Buenos Ayres likewise this Tyrant is not a common
species. Like other birds of its genus it has an easy, rapid flight, and
perches on trees or other elevated places, from which it occasionally
makes a dash at passing insects. The nest, as in <i>T. melancholicus</i>, is a
very slight structure of slender sticks, and the eggs are four, parchment
colour, and spotted at the large end with dark brown or chocolate.

<div class="blockdesc"><p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;Above grey with a slight greenish tinge; head with a concealed

tail brownish black with more or less of paler margins; beneath yellow, throat
greyish white, breast more or less greyish, under wing-coverts pale yellow; bill

</div>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Mexico and Central and South America down to Buenos
Ayres.</p>

<p>The violent and bold temper exhibited by most Tyrant-birds during
the breeding-season, a quality from which is derived the name of the
family, is perhaps carried to a greater degree in this species than in
any other; and when one spends many days or weeks in the marshy,
littoral forests, where the bird is most abundant, and hears its incessant<a class="pagenum" name="Page_159" id="Page_159">-&nbsp;159&nbsp;-</a>
distressful screams, the specific name <i>melancholicus</i> does not seem altogether
inappropriate; and that is the most that can be said of any
specific name invented by science, and which does not merely describe
some peculiarity of form or colour.</p>

<p>This Tyrant is one of the largest of its kind, its total length being
nearly nine inches. The wings are long and suited for an aerial
life; the legs are exceedingly short, and the feet are used for perching
only, for this species never alights on the ground. The throat and
upper parts are grey, tinged with olive on the back; the wings and tail
dark; the breast yellow tinged with green; the belly pure yellow.
Under the loose grey feathers of the crown is a fiery orange crest displayed
in moments of excitement.</p>

<p>In Buenos Ayres these birds arrive in September, after which their
shrill, angry cries are incessantly heard, while the birds are seen pursuing
each other through the air or in and out amongst the trees&mdash;perpetually
driven about by the contending passions of love, jealousy, and rage.
As soon as their domestic broils are over, a fresh war against the
whole feathered race begins, which does not cease until the business of
propagation is finished. I have frequently spent hours watching the
male, successively attacking, with scarcely an interval of rest, every
bird, big or little, approaching the sacred tree where its nest was
placed. Its indignation at the sight of a cowardly Carrion-Hawk
(<i>Milvago</i>) skulking about in search of small birds&rsquo; nests, and the boundless
fury of its onset, were wonderful to witness.</p>

<p>They are extremely active, and when not engaged in their endless
aerial battles, are pursuing large insects on the wing, usually returning
after each capture to their stand, from which they keep a jealous
watch on the movements of all winged things about them. They
are fond of marshy places and water-courses, where they perch on
a tall stalk to watch for insects, and also frequently skim over the
water like Swallows to drink and dip their feathers.</p>

<p>A tall tree is usually selected for the nest, which is not unfrequently
placed on the very topmost twigs, exposed to the sight of every creature
passing overhead, and as if in defiance of birds of prey. With such
an aggressive temper as this bird possesses it is not strange perhaps
that it builds in the most exposed places, from which the female, in
the absence of her vigilant consort, can keep a sharp eye on the movements
of her feathered neighbours; but I have often thought it
singular that they do not make a deeper receptacle for their eggs, for
the nest is merely a slight platform of slender sticks, and very ill-adapted
to retain its burden during high winds. The parasitical Cow-bird
never enters this nest, which is not strange.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_160" id="Page_160">-&nbsp;160&nbsp;-</a>The

yellow vertical crest; wings dark brown; tail black, outer web of the outer
rectrix white; beneath white; bill and feet black; three outer primaries
excised at the tips: whole length 14&middot;0 inches, wing 4&middot;6, tail 12&middot;0. <i>Female</i>
similar, but outer tail-feathers not so long.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Mexico, and Central and South America, down to Patagonia.</p>

<p>The <i>Tijereta</i> (Scissor-tail)&mdash;a name derived from the habit the bird
has of opening and closing the two long feathers of the tail when
flying&mdash;is found throughout South America, and in the summer of the
Southern Hemisphere ranges as far south as Patagonia.</p>

<p>The tail is forked, and the two outer feathers exceed by over four
inches in length the next two. The total length of the adult male is
fourteen inches, the tail being ten inches long; this species is therefore
one of the longest-tailed we know of. The tail of the female is
about two inches shorter than that of the male. The head is intense
black; the plumage of the crown is rather long and loose, and when
raised displays a vivid yellow crest. The neck and upper surface is
light, clear grey; the under surface pure white; the tail black.
During flight the two long feathers of the tail stream out behind like
a pair of black ribbons; frequently the bird pauses suddenly in its
flight, and then the two long feathers open out in the form of the
letter V.</p>

<p>The Scissor-tail is migratory, and arrives, already mated, at Buenos
Ayres at the end of September, and takes its departure at the end of
February in families&mdash;old and young birds together. In disposition and
general habits it resembles the true Tyrant-birds, but differs from them
in language, its various chirping and twittering notes having a hard
percussive sound, which Azara well compares to the snapping of castanets.
It prefers open situations with scattered trees and bushes; and
is also partial to marshy grounds, where it takes up a position on an
elevated stalk to watch for insects, and seizes them in the air like the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_161" id="Page_161">-&nbsp;161&nbsp;-</a>
Flycatcher. It also greedily devours elderberries and other small
fruits.</p>

<p>The nest is not deep, but is much more elaborately constructed than
is usual with the Tyrants. Soft materials are preferred, and in many
cases the nests are composed almost exclusively of wool. The inside is
cup-shaped, with a flat bottom, and is smooth and hard, the thistle-down
with which it is lined being cemented with gum. The eggs are
four, sharply pointed, light cream-colour, and spotted, chiefly at the
large end, with chocolate. In the breeding-time these Tyrants attack
other birds approaching the nest with great spirit, and have a particular
hatred to the Chimango, pursuing it with the greatest violence through
the air with angry notes, resembling in sound the whetting of a scythe,
but uttered with great rapidity and emphasis. How greatly this species
is imposed upon by the Cow-bird, notwithstanding its pugnacious
temper, we have already seen in my account of that bird.</p>

<p>The Scissor-tails have one remarkable habit; they are not gregarious,
but once every day, just before the sun sets, all the birds living near
together rise to the tops of the trees, calling to one another with loud,
excited chirps, and then mount upwards like rockets to a great height in
the air; then, after whirling about for a few moments, they precipitate
themselves downwards with the greatest violence, opening and shutting
their tails during their wild zigzag flight, and uttering a succession of
sharp, grinding notes. After this curious performance they separate in
pairs, and perching on the tree-tops each couple utters together its
rattling castanet notes, after which the company breaks up.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Argentine Republic.</p>

<p>I found this curious little bird quite common in Patagonia, where the
natives call it <i>Chingolo grande</i>, on account of its superficial resemblance
to the common Song-Sparrow (<i>Zonotrichia pileata</i>). The colouring of the
sexes differs considerably, the forehead and under surface of the male
being deep brick-red; the upper parts dull grey, with a bar on the
wing and the tips of the rectrices white; while in the female the upper
parts are yellowish grey, obscurely mottled, and the breast and belly
buff, with dark spots. In both sexes the eye is yellow, and the feathers
of the crown pileated to form a crest.</p>

<p>This bird is usually seen singly, but sometimes associates in small flocks;
it is resident, and a very weak flier, and feeds on tender buds and leaves,
berries and small seed. The male is frequently seen perched on the
summit of a bush, and, amidst the dull-plumaged species that people
the grey thickets of Patagonia, the bright red bosom gives it almost
a gay appearance. When singing, or uttering its alarm notes when the
nest is approached, its voice resembles the feeble bleatings of a small
kid or lamb. When approached it conceals itself in the bush, and
when flying progresses by a series of short jerky undulations, the wings
producing a loud humming sound.</p>

<p>The nest is made in the interior of a thorny bush, and built somewhat
slightly of fine twigs and lined with fibres. The eggs are four, bluish-green
in colour, with brownish flecks.</p>

<p>This species is found throughout the Argentine country, in dry, open
situations, abounding with a scanty tree and bush vegetation.</p>

<p>The <i>Dendrocolaptid&aelig;</i> are an important family in American Ornithology,
numbering some 220 species, and distributed in greater or less
abundance over every part of the Neotropical Region from Mexico to
Patagonia. Within Argentine limits 46 species occur.</p>

<p>While green is the characteristic colour of the <i>Tyrannid&aelig;</i>, brown is
the favoured hue of the <i>Dendrocolaptid&aelig;</i>, both the forest-loving and

arrayed in various shades of that sombre colour, to which a ferruginous
tail is a very frequent appendage.</p>

<p>The <i>Dendrocolaptid&aelig;</i> fall into four subfamilies, all of which have
representatives in Argentina. These are (1) the <i>Furnariin&aelig;</i>, or Oven-birds,
which are terrestrial in habits and have their feet adapted for
this mode of life; (2) the <i>Sclerurin&aelig;</i>, or Leaf-scrapers, known by their
spiny tail, which keep to the ground inside the forests; (3) the <i>Synallaxin&aelig;</i>,
or Sharp-tails, mostly bush-frequenting birds; and (4) the
<i>Dendrocolaptin&aelig;</i>, or Wood-hewers, which have the habits of our Creepers
(<i>Certhia</i>), and use their tail as a climbing-organ. All the members of
this great family feed exclusively on insects.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_166" id="Page_166">-&nbsp;166&nbsp;-</a>The
country people have a variety of names for this common and
well-known species. In Buenos Ayres it is usually called <i>Manea-cola</i>
(Shake-tail), in Patagonia <i>Caserita</i> (Little House-builder), and in
other places <i>Minera</i> (Miner) or <i>Caminante</i> (Traveller), from its habit
of running rapidly along a clean road or bridle-path before a person
riding or walking.</p>

<p>It is a stout little bird, with very short toes quite unsuited for
perching, and it does not, in fact, ever perch on a tree, though it
manages to cling to a perpendicular bank very well, when engaged in
opening its breeding-hole. It is resident and pairs for life, and lives in
sterile places, feeding on small insects and spiders. In manner it is
very lively, and runs swiftly over the bare ground, stopping very
abruptly, then running on again, and at every pause slowly moving its
half-open tail up and down. It flies swiftly, close to the ground, and
always during its short flight trills out its clear, ringing, rapidly
reiterated cry, which in sound resembles the laughter of a child.</p>

<p>On the grassy pampas the Miners invariably attach themselves to the
<i>Vizcacheras</i>&mdash;as the groups of great burrows made by the large rodent,
the Vizcacha, are called; for there is always a space free from grass
surrounding the burrows where the birds can run freely about. In the
sides of the deep pit-like entrance to one of these burrows the bird
bores a cylindrical hole, from three to six feet long, and terminating in
a circular chamber. This is lined with soft dry grass, and five white
eggs are laid.</p>

<p>Though the birds inhabit the Vizcacha village all the year, they seem
always to make a fresh hole to breed in every spring, the forsaken holes
being given up to the small Swallow, <i>Atticora cyanoleuca</i>.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay.</p>

<p>The Red Oven-bird is an extremely well-known species in Argentina,
and, where found, a great favourite on account of its familiarity with
man, its loud, ringing, cheerful voice, and its wonderful mud nest,
which it prefers to build near a human habitation, often on a cornice,
a projecting beam, or on the roof of the house itself.</p>

<p>It is a stout little bird, about 8&frac12; to 9 inches long, with a slender,
slightly-curved beak nearly an inch in length, and strong legs suited to
its terrestrial habits. The upper plumage is uniform rufous-brown in
colour, brightest on the tail; the under surface very light brown. It
ranges throughout the Argentine Republic to Bahia Blanca in the
south, and is usually named <i>Hornero</i> or <i>Casera</i> (Oven-bird or House-builder),
but in Paraguay and Corrientes it is called <i>Alonzo Garsia</i> or
<i>Alonzito</i>. Azara could give no reason for such a name; but it seems
to me that one need not look for one beyond the fact that this species
inspires an affectionate admiration in the country people: I mean in
those of <i>Spanish</i> origin, for the bird-killing French and Italians have
no tenderness for it. I have frequently been assured by natives that
the Hornero is a <i>pious</i> bird, and always suspends its labours on sacred
days. With this pretty belief about it in their minds, it is not strange
that in some districts they have called it by a human name.</p>

<p>It is resident, pairs for life, and finds its food, which consists of larv&aelig;
and worms, exclusively on the ground. It delights in open places,
where it can move freely about on the ground; and is partial to courtyards,
clean garden-walks, &amp;c., where, with head thrown back and<a class="pagenum" name="Page_168" id="Page_168">-&nbsp;168&nbsp;-</a>
bosom prominent, it struts along with an air of great gravity, lifting its
foot high at each step, and holding it suspended for a moment in the
air before setting it firmly down. I once saw one fly down on to a
narrow plank about ten feet long lying out on the wet grass; it walked
gravely to the end of the plank, then turned, and deliberately walked
back to the other end, and so on for about twenty times, appearing to
take the greatest pleasure in the mere act of promenading on a smooth
level surface. When disturbed, the Oven-bird has a loud, monotonous
note of alarm or curiosity, which never fails to bring all its fellows
within hearing-distance to the spot. The movements of a fox, weasel,
or cat in a plantation can always be known from the noisy turmoil
among the Oven-birds. At frequent intervals during the day the male
and female meet and express their joy in clear, resonant notes sung in
concert&mdash;a habit common to a very large number of Dendrocolaptine
birds, including, I think, all those species which pair for life. In a
majority of species this vocal performance merely consists of a succession
of confused notes or cries, uttered with great spirit and emphasis;
in the Oven-bird it has developed into a kind of harmonious singing.
Thus, the first bird, on the appearance of its mate flying to the place of
meeting, emits loud measured notes, sometimes a continuous trilling
note with a somewhat hollow metallic sound; but immediately on the
other bird joining, this introductory passage is changed to rapid triplets,
strongly accented on the first and last notes, while the second bird utters a
series of loud measured notes perfectly according with the triplets of the
first. While thus singing they stand facing each other, their necks
outstretched, wings hanging, and tails spread, the first bird trembling
with its rapid utterances, the second beating on the branch with its
wings. The finale consists of three or four notes uttered by the second
bird alone, and becoming successively louder and more piercing until
the end. There is an infinite variety in the tone in which different
couples sing, also in the order in which the different notes are uttered,
and even the same couple do not repeat their duet in precisely the same
way; but it is always a rhythmical and, to some extent, an harmonious
performance, and as the voices have a ringing, joyous character, it
always produces a pleasing effect on the mind.</p>

<p>In favourable seasons the Oven-birds begin building in the autumn,
and the work is resumed during the winter whenever there is a spell of
mild wet weather. Some of their structures are finished early in winter,
others not until spring, everything depending on the weather and the
condition of the birds. In cold dry weather, and when food is scarce,
they do not work at all. The site chosen is a stout horizontal branch, or
the top of a post, and they also frequently build on a cornice or the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_169" id="Page_169">-&nbsp;169&nbsp;-</a>
roof of a house; and sometimes, but rarely, on the ground. The
material used is mud, with the addition of horsehair or slender fibrous
rootlets, which make the structure harder and prevent it from cracking.
I have frequently seen a bird, engaged in building, first pick up a thread
or hair, then repair to a puddle, where it was worked into a pellet of
mud about the size of a filbert, then carried to the nest. When finished
the structure is shaped outwardly like a baker&rsquo;s oven, only with a deeper
and narrower entrance. It is always placed very conspicuously, and
with the entrance facing a building, if one be near, or if at a roadside
it looks toward the road; the reason for this being, no doubt, that the
bird keeps a cautious eye on the movements of people near it while
building, and so leaves the nest opened and unfinished on that side until
the last, and there the entrance is necessarily formed. When the
structure has assumed the globular form with only a narrow opening,
the wall on one side is curved inwards, reaching from the floor to the
dome, and at the inner extremity an aperture is left to admit the bird to
the interior or second chamber, in which the eggs are laid. A man&rsquo;s hand
fits easily into the first or entrance chamber, but cannot be twisted about
so as to reach the eggs in the interior cavity, the entrance being so
small and high up. The interior is lined with dry soft grass, and five
white pear-shaped eggs are laid. The <i>oven</i> is a foot or more in diameter,
and is sometimes very massive, weighing eight or nine pounds, and so
strong that, unless loosened by the swaying of the branch, it often
remains unharmed for two or three years. The birds incubate by turns,
and when one returns from the feeding-ground it sings its loud notes,
on which the sitting bird rushes forth to join in the joyous chorus, and
then flies away, the other taking its place on the eggs. The young are
exceedingly garrulous, and when only half-fledged may be heard practising
trills and duets in their secure oven, in shrill tremulous voices,
which change to the usual hunger-cry of young birds when the parent
enters with food. After leaving the nest, the old and young birds live
for two or three months together, only one brood being raised in each
year. A new oven is built every year, and I have more than once seen
a second oven built on the top of the first, when this has been placed
very advantageously, as on a projection and against a wall.</p>

<p>A very curious thing occurred at the estancia house of a neighbour
of mine in Buenos Ayres one spring. A pair of Oven-birds built their
oven on a beam-end projecting from the wall of a rancho. One morning
one of the birds was found caught in a steel trap placed the evening
before for rats, and both of its legs were crushed above the knee. On
being liberated it flew up to and entered the oven, where it bled to
death, no doubt, for it did not come out again. Its mate remained two<a class="pagenum" name="Page_170" id="Page_170">-&nbsp;170&nbsp;-</a>
days, calling incessantly, but there were no other birds of its kind in
the place, and it eventually disappeared. Three days later it returned
with a new mate, and immediately the two birds began carrying pellets
of mud to the oven, with which they plastered up the entrance. Afterwards
they built a second oven, using the sepulchre of the dead bird for
its foundation, and here they reared their young. My neighbour, an
old native, had watched the birds from the time the first oven was
begun, feeling greatly interested in their diligent ways, and thinking
their presence at his house a good omen; and it was not strange that,
after witnessing the entombment of one that died, he was more convinced
than ever that the little House-builders are &ldquo;pious birds.&rdquo;</p>

birds are very common in Patagonia, being resident there;
some individuals, however, migrate north in winter, and I once obtained
a pair, male and female, near Buenos Ayres city in the month of June.</p>

<p>Their legs are short, but on the ground their movements are very
rapid, and, like the Miner (<i>Geositta</i>) already described, they fly reluctantly,
preferring to run rapidly from a person walking or riding,
and at such times they look curiously like a very small Curlew with an
extravagantly long beak. They are active, lively birds, and live in
pairs, sometimes uniting in small, loose flocks; they are partial to places
where scattered bushes grow on a dry sterile soil, and have a swift low
flight; when flying they frequently utter a shrill, trilling, or rapidly
reiterated note, in sound resembling laughter. In manners, flight,
language, and colouring this bird closely resembles the smaller short-beaked
<i>Geositta cunicularia</i>, and like that species it also breeds in deep
holes in banks; but I am not able to say whether it excavates the
breeding-hole or takes possession of one already made. Durnford found
it breeding in a hole four feet deep in the bank of a dry lagoon. The
nest was of dry grass and lined with the fur of the cavy. It contained
three white eggs.</p>

<p>This homely little species differs considerably from most Dendrocolaptine
birds in colour and habits; and being of a uniform dull, fuscous
hue, its appearance is most uninteresting. It inhabits the whole of
Patagonia, but is migratory, possessing, what is rare in this family, a
powerful flight. In winter it is common all over the pampas and the
Plata district, ranging north to Paraguay. It is always found near water,
its favourite hunting-ground being the borders of a stream. On the
ground its motions are quick and lively, but when perching on a tree it
sits motionless in one position, and when attempting to move appears to
lose its balance. These birds cannot be called strictly gregarious, but
where abundant they are fond of gathering in loose flocks, sometimes
numbering one or two hundred individuals, and when thus associating<a class="pagenum" name="Page_173" id="Page_173">-&nbsp;173&nbsp;-</a>
are very playful, frequently pursuing and wheeling about each other,
and uttering a sharp, trilling note. On a warm day in winter they are
occasionally heard attempting to sing, the bird darting up vertically
into the air and pouring out with great energy a confused torrent of
unmelodious sounds.</p>

<p>Their habits, so much less sedate and strikingly in contrast with
those of most of the birds in this family, are no doubt due to the
greater powers of flight possessed by <i>Cinclodes</i>.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Chili, Patagonia, and Argentina.</p>

<p>This is one of our few strictly migratory species in the family
<i>Dendrocolaptid&aelig;</i>. Probably it winters in South Brazil, as in the
northern parts of the Argentine country it is said to be a summer
visitor. On the pampas it appears in September, and all at once
becomes very abundant in the rush-beds growing in the water, where
alone it is found. The migration no doubt is very extensive, for in
spring I found it abundant in the rush-beds in the Rio Negro valley,
and Durnford met with it much further south on the river Sanguelen, a
tributary of the Chupat. Migratory birds are, as a rule, very little
given to wandering; that is to say, they do not go much beyond the
limits of the little coppice, reed-bed, or spot of ground which they
make their summer home, and this species is no exception. It
spends the warm season secluded in its rush-bed: and when disturbed
flies with great reluctance, fluttering feebly away to a distance of a few
yards, and then dropping into the rushes again, apparently quite
incapable of a sustained flight. How a bird so feeble on the wing, and
retiring in its habits, is able to perform a long, annual migration, when
in traversing vast tracts of open country it must be in great peril from
rapacious kinds, is a great mystery. No doubt many perish while
travelling; but there is this circumstance in their favour: an incredible
number of birds of various kinds, many as weak and exposed to attack
as the <i>Phl&oelig;ocryptes</i>, migrate simultaneously; Hawks are very thinly
scattered along their route, and as a rule these birds feed only once or
twice a day, if the meals are large enough to fill the stomach, so that
while the Hawk is inactive, digesting his meal, thousands of migrants
have sped by on their journey and are beyond his reach for ever.</p>

<p>This Spine-tail seldom ventures out of its rush-bed, but is
occasionally seen feeding in the grass and herbage a few yards removed
from the water. Its language is peculiar, this being a long cicada-like
note, followed by a series of sounds like smart taps on a piece of dry
wood. It frequents the same places as the small Many-coloured Tyrant
(<i>Cyanotis azar&aelig;</i>), and these little neighbours, being equally inquisitive,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_176" id="Page_176">-&nbsp;176&nbsp;-</a>
whenever a person approaches the rushes often emerge together, one
uttering wooden-sounding creaks and raps, the other liquid gurgling
notes&mdash;a little brown bird and a little bird with many bright colours,
both, in very different tones, demanding to know the reason of the
intrusion.</p>

<p>The nest is a very wonderful structure, and is usually attached to
three upright stems; it is domed, oval-shaped, about nine inches deep,
and the small circular aperture which is close to the top is protected
by a sloping tile-like projection. It is built of tough grass-leaves,
which are apparently first daubed with wet clay and then ingeniously
woven in, with the addition, I think, of some kind of mucilage: the
whole nest is, when finished, light but very strong, and impervious to
wet. Until the rushes die and drop the nest remains securely fastened
to them, and in winter affords a safe and comfortable retreat to the
small reed-frogs, of which sometimes as many as three or four are found
living in one nest. The interior is very thickly lined with feathers;
the eggs are three, pear-shaped, and a bright, beautiful blue colour,
sometimes with a slight greenish tinge.</p>

<p>The bird is so abundant in extensive marshes that I have on several
occasions, during a day&rsquo;s ramble, found as many as forty or fifty nests,
sometimes a dozen or more being placed close together, but I have never
taken more than three eggs from one nest. I mention this because I
have seen it stated that four or five eggs are sometimes found.</p>

<p>I trust that no reader of this sketch imagines that I robbed all the
eggs contained in so many nests. I did nothing so barbarous, although
it is perhaps &ldquo;prattling out of fashion&rdquo; to say so; but with the
destructive, useless egg-collecting passion I have no sympathy. By
bending the pliant rushes downwards the eggs can be made to roll out
into the hand; and all those which I thus took out to count were, I am
glad to say, put back in their wonderful cradles. I had a special object
in examining so many nests. A gaucho boy once brought me a nest
which had a small circular <i>stopper</i>, made of the same texture as the
body of the nest, attached to the aperture at the <i>side</i>, and when swung
round into it fitting it as perfectly as the lid of the trap-door spider fits
the burrow. I have no doubt that it was used to close the nest when
the bird was away, perhaps to prevent the intrusion of reed-frogs or of
other small birds; but I have never found another nest like it, nor have
I heard of one being found by any one else; and that one nest, with
its perfectly-fitting stopper, has been a puzzle to my mind ever since
I saw it.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Chili, Argentina, and Patagonia.</p>

<p>This is a restless little bird, seen singly or in parties of three or four.
In manner and appearance it resembles the Long-tailed Titmouse
(<i>Parus</i>), as it diligently searches for small insects in the trees and
bushes, frequently hanging head downwards to explore the under surface
of a leaf or twig, and while thus engaged continually uttering a little
sharp querulous note. They are not migratory, but in winter seem to
wander about from place to place a great deal; and in Patagonia, in the
cold season, I have frequently seen them uniting in flocks of thirty or
forty individuals, and associating with numbers of Spine-tails of other
species, chiefly with <i>Synallaxis sordida</i>, and all together advancing
through the thicket, carefully exploring every bush in their way.</p>

<p>D&rsquo;Orbigny says that it makes a nest of rootlets and moss in a bush;
but where I have observed this bird it invariably breeds in a hole in a
tree, or in the nest of some other bird, often in the clay structure of
the Oven-bird. But in Patagonia, where the Oven-bird is not known,
this Spine-tail almost always selects the nest of the <i>Synallaxis sordida</i>.
It carries in a great deal of soft material&mdash;soft grass, wool, and feathers&mdash;to
reline the cavity, and lays five or six, white, pointed eggs.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Southern Brazil and Argentina.</p>

<p>I like Azara&rsquo;s name <i>Chicli</i>, which, to one acquainted with the habits
of this and of the following species, seems very appropriate, suggesting,
as I imagine it does, a small creature possessing a sharp two-syllabled
note; for although Hartlaub, in his Nomenclature of Azara, gives
<i>S. ruficapilla</i> as the species meant by <i>Chicli</i>, the account of its habits
in the &lsquo;Apuntamientos&rsquo; seems to point to <i>S. spixi</i> or to <i>S. albescens</i>.</p>

<p>Azara says:&mdash;&ldquo;I give it this name because it sings it plainly, in a loud
sharp tone, which may be heard at a distance, repeating it so frequently
that the pauses last no longer than the sound. It is resident (in Paraguay),
solitary and not abundant: inhabits thickets of aloes and thorn,
without rising more than two yards above the surface, or showing itself
in open places. It moves about incessantly, but does not leave its
thicket to visit the woods or open ground, its flight being only from
bush to bush; and though it is not timid, it is hard to detect it in its
stronghold, and to hear it one would imagine that it was perched overhead
on a tree, when it is hidden all the time in the brushwood at the
roots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This habit of concealing itself so closely inclines me to think that
this species, rather than <i>S. albescens</i>, was the bird described by Azara,
although in both species the language is nearly the same. I have nothing
to add to the above account from the &lsquo;Apuntamientos,&rsquo; except that in the
love-season this species has a low, strange-sounding little song, utterly
unlike its usual strident cry. When singing, it sits motionless on the
summit of a low bush in a dejected attitude with head drawn in, and
murmurs its mysterious little melody at intervals of half a minute.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> S. America, from Veragua to Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>This species, although by no means abundant in Buenos Ayres, is
met with much more frequently than the <i>S. spixi</i>, which it closely resembles
in size, colour, habits, and language. It is, indeed, an unusual
thing for two species so closely allied to be found inhabiting the same
district. In both birds the colours are arranged in precisely the same
way; but the chestnut tint on <i>S. albescens</i> is not nearly so deep, the
browns and greys are paler, and there is less black on the throat.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure that in Buenos Ayres it is migratory, and as soon
as it appears in spring it announces its arrival by its harsh, persistent,
two-syllabled note, wonderfully strong for so small a bird, and
which it repeats at intervals of two or three seconds for half an hour
without intermission. When close at hand it is quite as distressing as
the grinding noise of a Cicada. This painful noise is uttered while the
bird sits concealed amid the foliage of a tree, and is renewed at frequent
intervals, and continues every day until the Spine-tail finds a mate,
when all at once it becomes silent. The nest is placed in a low thorn-bush,
sometimes only two or three feet above the ground, and is an
oblong structure of sticks, twelve or fourteen inches in depth, with the
entrance near the top, and reached by a tubular passage made of slender
sticks, and six or seven inches long. From the top of the nest a
crooked passage leads to the cavity near the bottom; this is lined with
a little fine grass, and nine eggs are laid, pear-shaped and pale bluish
white in colour. I have found several nests with nine eggs, and therefore
set that down as the full number of the clutch, though I confess it
seems very surprising that this bird should lay so many. When the
nest is approached, the parent birds remain silent and concealed at
some distance. When the nest is touched or shaken, the young birds,
if nearly fledged, have the singular habit of running out and jumping
to the ground to conceal themselves in the grass.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that this species varies greatly in its habits in
different districts, and probably also in the number of eggs it lays.
Mr. Barrows, an excellent observer, says it lays three or four light blue
eggs. He met with it at Concepcion, in the northern part of the
Argentine Republic, and writes that it is &ldquo;an abundant species in thorny
hedges or among the masses of dwarfed and spiny bushes, which cling
to each other so tenaciously amid the general desolation of the sandy
barrens.&rdquo; The nests which he describes vary also in some particulars<a class="pagenum" name="Page_181" id="Page_181">-&nbsp;181&nbsp;-</a>
from those I have seen. &ldquo;Entrance is gained by the bird,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;through a long tube, which is built on to the nest at a point about
half way up the side. This tube is formed by the interlocking of
thorny twigs, and is supported by the branches and twigs about it. It
may be straight or curved; its diameter externally varies from two to
four inches, and its length from one to two feet. The passage-way
itself is but just large enough to admit the birds one at a time, and it
has always been a mystery to me how a bird the size of a Chipping-Sparrow
could find its way through one of these slender tubes, bristling
with thorns, and along which I found it difficult to pass a smooth
slender twig for more than five or six inches. Yet they not only pass
in and out easily, but so easily that I was never yet able to surprise one
in the nest, or to see the slightest disturbance of it by the bird&rsquo;s hurried
exit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bird has a very wide range in South America, and Mr. Salmon
observed its breeding-habits in Antioquia in Colombia. There also the
bird varies the form of its nest, making it as large as that of an English
Magpie, and roofing the top with a mass of large leaves to protect it
from the heavy rains. The eggs, he says, are very pale greenish blue,
nearly white; but he does not give the number.</p>

<p>This pretty Spine-tail is nowhere common in the Argentine country,
and in Buenos Ayres it is exceedingly scarce. It is rather large for a
<i>Synallaxis</i>, the total length being nine inches. The two middle
feathers of the acuminated tail greatly exceed the others in length,
measuring five inches. The plumage is very pale brown, marked with
fuscous; the crown and wing-coverts rufous. The beauty of the bird
is in the throat, which has three strongly contrasted colours, distinguishing
it from all other <i>Synallaxes</i>. In the angle of the beak the

eggs at a distance of almost three feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This species has a wide range south of the Equator, being found in
Bolivia, Uruguay, and throughout the Argentine Republic, including
Patagonia. In its habits it differs widely from other <i>Synallaxes</i>, and
in structure and coloration is also unlike its relatives.</p>

<p>The beak is longer and more curved, the claws more crooked, and
the tail stiffer than in other <i>Synallaxes</i>, and this difference in structure
corresponds to a different mode of life. The Striped Spine-tail creeps
on the trunk and larger branches of trees, seeking its insect-food in
the crevices of the bark, and when seen clinging to the trunk, supported
by its tail in a vertical position, with head thrown far back, and progressing
upwards by short quick hops, it looks wonderfully like a
small <i>Picolaptes</i> with shortened beak. It is very restless, and while
searching for insects constantly utters a short, trilling, querulous-sounding
note.</p>

<p>It builds an open nest in the fork of a branch, of soft grasses and
hair, thickly lined with feathers, and lays four or five pure white eggs.</p>

<p>It does not migrate, and lives with its mate in thorny bushes, but does
not attempt to conceal itself, and sits much on the summit of a bush,
where the male in spring utters at intervals a clear trilling call. In
its inactive disposition, slow deliberate movements, also in its
language, it strikingly resembles the <i>Phacellodomus ruber</i>. In its
nidification<a class="pagenum" name="Page_185" id="Page_185">-&nbsp;185&nbsp;-</a> it also comes nearest to that species. The nest is a large
structure of sticks, eighteen inches to two feet long, placed upright
among the twigs at the summit of a bush. From the top where the entrance
is placed, a winding passage leads down to the chamber at the bottom of
the nest; this is lined with soft dry grass and feathers, and four pure
white eggs are laid.</p>

<p>I have found this <i>Synallaxis</i>, which was first described by Prof.
Burmeister, from specimens obtained near Buenos Ayres, in the
swamps along the Plata river; also on the Rio Negro, in Patagonia,
where, however, it is very scarce. It inhabits the dense rush-beds
growing in the water, where the <i>Limnornis curvirostris</i> is also found.
It closely resembles that species in habits and language, and also assimilates
to it in colour and in the rather long, curved beak, sharp claws,
stout body, and short stiff tail. It is stationary, pairs for life, and
lives always closely concealed in its chosen bed of close-growing
rushes. When a person approaches their hiding-place the two birds
creep up to the summit of the rushes, protesting in peculiar, loud,
angry rattling notes. The <i>Limnornis</i>, which also pairs for life, has
precisely the same habit.</p>

domed structure of grass, with the aperture at the side; the eggs white.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Patagonia.</p>

<p>This dull-coloured little bird, which is found in Patagonia and also
near the Andes in the north-western provinces of the Argentine
Republic, is one of those species which diverge greatly in habits from
the typical <i>S. ruficapilla</i> and its nearest allies. The body is stout, the
tail, square and short, is carried vertically as in the House-Wren.</p>

<p>The Patagonian Spine-tail is a resident in the Rio Negro district.
It is a silent, shy, solitary little bird, which lives on the ground and
seeks its food after the manner of the Cachalote (<i>Homorus</i>). Being
small and feeble, however, it does not hunt about the roots of trees
and large bushes like the larger and more powerful <i>Homorus</i>, but
keeps under the diminutive scrubby plants in open sterile situations.
About the roots of these wiry little bushes, only twelve to eighteen
inches high, the bird searches for small insects, and when disturbed has
a feeble jerky flight, which carries it to a distance of about twenty yards.
It flies with great reluctance, and when approached runs swiftly away,
leaving a person in doubt as to whether he has seen a mouse or a little
obscure bird. The only note I have heard it utter is a faint creaking
sound when alarmed or flying.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Argentina.</p>

<p>This Spine-tail, which Sclater has named after me, is the Argentine
representative of <i>S. humicola</i> of Chili. It is common on the pampas,
and is sometimes called by the gauchos &ldquo;<i>Tiru-riru del campo</i>,&rdquo; on
account of its resemblance in the upper plumage and in language to
<i>Anumbius acuticaudatus</i>, which is named &ldquo;<i>Tiru-riru</i>,&rdquo; in imitation
of its call-note. The addition of <i>del campo</i> signifies that it is a bird of
the open country. It is, in fact, found exclusively on the grassy
pampas, never perching on trees, and in habits is something like a
Pipit, usually being taken for one when first seen. It is quite common
everywhere on the pampas, and specimens have also been obtained in
Cordova, Uruguay, and Patagonia.</p>

<p>This Spine-tail is resident, solitary, and extremely timid and stealthy
in its movements, living always on the ground among the long grass and
cardoon-thistles. At times its inquisitiveness overcomes its timidity,
and the bird then darts up three or four yards into the air, and jerking
its tail remains some moments poised aloft with breast towards the
intruder, emitting sharp little notes of alarm, after which it darts
down again and disappears in the grass. When driven up it has a wild
zigzag flight, and after reaching a considerable height in the air darts
down again with astonishing swiftness, and comes back to the very
spot from which it rose. It is, however, incapable of sustained flight,
and after being flushed two or three times refuses to rise again. In
spring the male perches on the summit of a cardoon-bush, or other
slight elevation, and at regular intervals utters a pleasing and melancholy
kind of song or call, which can be heard distinctly at a distance
of a thousand yards, composed of four long clear plaintive notes,
increasing in strength, and succeeded by a falling trill. When
approached it becomes silent, and dropping to the ground conceals
itself in the grass. Under a cardoon-bush or tussock of grass it
scoops out a slight hollow in the ground, and builds over this a dome
of fine dry grass, leaving a small aperture arched like the door of a
baker&rsquo;s oven. The bed is lined with dry powdered horse-dung, and the
eggs are five, bluntly pointed and of a very pale buff colour. The interior
of the nest is so small that when the five young birds are fledged they<a class="pagenum" name="Page_188" id="Page_188">-&nbsp;188&nbsp;-</a>
appear to be packed together very closely, so that it is difficult to
conceive how the parent bird passes in and out.</p>

<p>The nest is always very cunningly concealed, and I have often
spent days searching in a patch of cardoon-bushes where the birds were
breeding without being able to find it.</p>

<p>D&rsquo;Orbigny discovered this small Spine-tail near Buenos Ayres city,
but did not record its habits. Like the species just described it is
abundant on the pampas, but in its habits resembles a Wren of the
genus <i>Cistothorus</i> rather than a Pipit, being partial to moist situations,
where there is a rank growth of grass and herbage. The wings are
very short, and the flight so feeble that the bird refuses to rise after
being pursued a distance of one or two hundred yards. And yet I
am not prepared to say that it does not migrate, as I have found that in
spring it all at once becomes very abundant, while in the cold season
it is rarely seen. It is solitary, and in spring sits on a thistle or stalk,
uttering at short intervals its small grasshopper-like song or call.
The nest is a slight open structure of grass, lined with a few feathers,
placed in a tuft of grass or reeds. The eggs are pure white in colour.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay.</p>

<p>This is a common and very well-known species throughout the
Argentine country and Patagonia, also in Uruguay and Paraguay, and
is variously called <i>Espinero</i> (Thorn-bird), <i>Tiru-riru</i>, in imitation of its
note, and <i>A&ntilde;umbi</i> (the Guarani name); but its best known name is
<i>Le&ntilde;atero</i>, or &ldquo;Firewood-Gatherer,&rdquo; from the quantity of sticks which
it collects for building-purposes.</p>

<p>The Firewood-Gatherer is a resident in Argentina, and pairs for life.
Sometimes the young birds remain with their parents for a period of
three or four months, all the family going about and feeding in company,
and roosting together in the old nest. The nest and the tree<a class="pagenum" name="Page_190" id="Page_190">-&nbsp;190&nbsp;-</a>
where it is placed are a favourite resort all the year round. Here the
birds sit perched a great deal, and repeat at intervals a song or call,
composed of four or five loud ticking chirps, followed by a long trilling
note. They feed exclusively on the ground, where they creep about,
carrying the body horizontally and intently searching for insects.
When disturbed, they hurry to their usual refuge, rapidly beating their
very feeble wings, and expanding the broad acuminated tail like a fan.
When the male and female meet at their nest, after a brief separation,
they sing their notes in concert, as if rejoicing over their safe reunion;
but they seldom separate, and Azara says that when one incubates, the
other sits at the entrance to the nest, and that when one returns to the
nest with food for the young the other accompanies it, though it has
found nothing to carry.</p>

<p>To build, the <i>A&ntilde;umbi</i> makes choice of an isolated tree in an open
situation, and prefers a dwarf tree with very scanty foliage; for small
projecting twigs and leaves hinder the worker when carrying up sticks.
This is a most laborious operation, as the sticks are large and the bird&rsquo;s
flight is feeble. If the tree is to its liking, it matters not how much
exposed to the winds it may be, or how close to a human habitation, for
the bird is utterly unconcerned by the presence of man. I have frequently
seen a nest in a shade or ornamental tree within ten yards of the
main entrance to a house; and I have also seen several on the tall upright
stakes of a horse-corral, and the birds working quietly, with a herd of
half-wild horses rushing round the enclosure beneath them, pursued by
the men with lassos. The bird uses large sticks for building, and drops
a great many; frequently as much fallen material as would fill a
barrow lies under the tree. The fallen stick is not picked up again, as
the bird could not rise vertically with its load, and is not intelligent
enough, I suppose, to recover the fallen stick, and to carry it away
thirty yards from the tree and then rise obliquely. It consequently
goes far afield in quest of a fresh one, and having got one to its liking,
carefully takes it up exactly by the middle, and, carrying it like a
balancing-pole, returns to the nest, where, if one end happens to hit
against a projecting twig, it drops like the first. The bird is not discouraged,
but, after a brief interview with its mate, flies cheerfully
away to gather more wood.</p>

<p>Durnford writes wonderingly of the partiality for building in poplar
trees shown by this bird in Buenos Ayres, and says that in a tall tree
the nest is sometimes placed sixty or seventy feet above the ground,
and that the bird almost invariably rises with a stick at such a distance
from the tree as to be able just to make the nest, but that sometimes
failing it alights further down, and then climbs up the twigs with its<a class="pagenum" name="Page_191" id="Page_191">-&nbsp;191&nbsp;-</a>
stick. He attributes the choice of the tall poplar to <i>ambition</i>; but the
<i>A&ntilde;umbi</i> has really a much simpler and lowlier motive. In the rich
Buenos Ayres soil all trees have a superabundance of foliage, and in
the slim poplar alone can the nest be placed where the bird can reach
it laden with building-material, without coming in contact with long
projecting twigs.</p>

<p>The nest of the <i>A&ntilde;umbi</i> is about two feet in depth, and from ten to
twelve inches in diameter, and rests in an oblique position amongst the
branches. The entrance is at the top, and a crooked or spiral passage-way
leads down to the lower extremity, where the breeding-chamber is
situated; this is lined with wool and soft grass, and five white eggs
are laid, varying considerably in form, some being much more sharply
pointed than others.</p>

<p>The nest, being so secure and comfortable an abode, is greatly coveted
by several other species of birds to breed in; but on this subject I have
already spoken in the account of the genus <i>Molothrus</i>. When deprived
of their nest, the birds immediately set to work to make a new one;
but often enough, without being ejected from the first they build a
second nest, sometimes demolishing the first work to use the materials.
I watched one pair make three nests before laying; another pair made
two nests, and after the second was completed they returned to the
first and there elected to remain. Two or three nests are sometimes
seen on one tree, and Azara says he has seen as many as six. Mr.
Barrows observed the bird at Concepcion, where it is very common,
and writes that in that district the nest is sometimes four feet long with
an average diameter of two feet, and that the same nest in some cases
is used for several seasons successively; also that several nests are
sometimes joined together and all occupied at the same time.</p>

twigs among the terminal sprays of some slender branch which juts out
horizontally from a tree, or rises obliquely from near its base, and
around these twigs as a nucleus more are gathered, until, by the time
the nest has reached the proper size, its weight has bent the branch so
that its tip points directly to the earth. Nests which are thus begun
at a distance of fifteen or twenty feet from the ground are often only
two or three feet from it when finished, and a thorough soaking by a
heavy rain will sometimes weigh them down until they actually touch.
They are more or less oval or cylindrical in shape, and commonly about
two feet long by twelve or fifteen inches in diameter, and contain from
a peck to a bushel of twigs and thorns. The nest-cavity within is
small in proportion to the size of the nest, and occupies its upper part.
It is reached by a more or less direct passage-way from below, the
external opening being very nearly at the lowest part of the nest,
though sometimes a little shelf, or even a pocket, is built on to the side,
forming a resting-place in front of the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The nests vary interminably in size and shape, but are pretty constant
in the material used; this being almost always irregular and
thorny twigs of various trees growing in the neighbourhood, while the
interior is formed of less thorny twigs and with some wool and hair.
Usually, also, if the material be at hand, a quantity of old dry horse-droppings
is placed loosely on the top of the nest, and gradually becomes
felted into it, rendering it more nearly waterproof. In place of this
I have frequently found quantities of broken straw, weed-stalks, grass,
and even chips; all doubtless collected from the ridges of drift which
the last overflow of the river had left near at hand. So compactly is
the whole nest built, that it often lasts more than one year, and may
sometimes serve the same pair two successive summers. More often,
however, a new nest is built directly above the old one, which serves as
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_194" id="Page_194">-&nbsp;194&nbsp;-</a>
a foundation, and occasionally as many as three nests are seen thus on
the same branch-tip, two of them at least being occupied. When
other branches of the same tree are similarly loaded, and other trees
close at hand also bear the same kind of fruit, the result is very
picturesque. The eggs, which are white, are laid from October 1 to
January 1, but many of the birds work at nest-building all the winter,
sometimes spending months on a single nest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is a common species throughout the eastern portion of the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_195" id="Page_195">-&nbsp;195&nbsp;-</a>
Argentine country, and extends as far south as the southern boundary
of the Buenos Ayrean province.</p>

<p>It is resident, living in pairs in places where there are scattered
thorny trees and bushes, and is never found in deep woods. It never
attempts to conceal itself, but, on the contrary, sits exposed on a bush
and will allow a person to approach within three or four yards of it.
Nor has it the restless manner of most Synallaxine birds which live
in the same places with it, but moves in a slow deliberate way, and
spends a great deal of time sitting motionless on its perch, occasionally
uttering its call or song, composed of a series of long, shrill, powerful
notes in descending scale and uttered in a very leisurely manner. It
builds a large oblong nest of sticks, about two feet deep, and placed
obliquely among the thorny twigs of a bush or low tree. Mr. Barrows
writes:&mdash;&ldquo;There are commonly two cavities in the nest, one being half
open to the weather, and forming the entrance, the other further
back and connected with the former by only a short passage-way, which
in many cases is reduced to a simple hole through a broad partition,
which alone separates them.&rdquo; The eggs are four and of a pure white.</p>

<p>The name commonly used for this species is founded on the &ldquo;<i>Anumb&eacute;
roxo</i>&rdquo; of Azara&rsquo;s &lsquo;Apuntamientos&rsquo;; but the description given there of
the bird&rsquo;s nesting-habits shows either that some other species was meant&mdash;perhaps
<i>P. sibilatrix</i>, D&ouml;ring&mdash;or that the nesting-habits of a different
bird have been assigned to <i>P. ruber</i>.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Argentina.</p>

<p>This species interested me greatly during my observations of the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_196" id="Page_196">-&nbsp;196&nbsp;-</a>
Argentine birds, but, owing to its rarity and to its recluse habits, my
knowledge of it is very scanty. It is found in the north and north-western
parts of the Argentine territory; in the province of Buenos
Ayres its presence is confined to the narrow strip of subtropical wood
fringing the low shores of the Plata river.</p>

<p>When surprised, its white eye, blue dagger-like beak, and raised crest
give it a strikingly bold and angry appearance, the effect of which is
heightened by the harsh rasping scream it utters when disturbed. This
resentful look is deceptive, however, for the bird is the shiest creature
imaginable. Its language has the shrill excited character common to
this most loquacious family; and at intervals throughout the day two
birds, male and female, meet together and make the woods echo
with their screaming concert. For many weeks after I had become
familiar with these loud-sounding notes, while collecting in the littoral
forest where it is found, the bird was still to me only a &ldquo;wandering
voice&rdquo;; but I did not give up the pursuit till I had seen it several
times and had also secured two or three specimens. I found one nest,
though without eggs, a rough-looking domed structure, made with
material enough to fill a barrow. I also discovered that the bird feeds
exclusively on the ground, close to the boles of low-branching trees,
where there is usually an accumulation of fallen bark, dead leaves, and
other rubbish. Here the bird digs with its sharp beak for the small
insects it preys on. When approached it does not fly away, but runs
swiftly to the nearest tree, behind the trunk of which it hides, then
scuttles on to the next tree, and so escapes without showing itself.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrows, who observed the Cachalote at Concepcion, says that
it is a bird which cannot be overlooked, with an outrageous disposition
and voice, and a nest the size of a barrel. He gives the following
account of its nidification:&mdash;&ldquo;His nest is built entirely of sticks, and
many of them of goodly size, frequently as large round as your little
finger and two feet or more long. These are disposed in such a way
as to form a structure three or four feet in length by about two in
breadth in the widest part, the whole very much resembling a gigantic
powder-flask lying on its side among the lower branches of a spreading
tree. It is quite loosely built and the nest-cavity is rather indefinite,
being any portion of the floor of the nest which the bird selects for
the reception of the eggs. These are usually three or four in number,
pure white, and are laid from October until January. They can usually
be counted through the loose floor of the nest, though sometimes its
thickness prevents this.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Patagonia.</p>

<p>I found this bird quite common on the dry open plains in the
neighbourhood of the Rio Negro in Patagonia. In size, form, and
crest it is like the northern Cachalote, but has a white throat, while
the rest of the plumage is of a pale earthy brown instead of rufous.
Like the Brown Cachalote it is also shy in disposition, and, being so dull
in colour and without the bright beak and eye tints, has not the bold,
striking appearance of that species; still I do not think any ornithologist
can meet with it and fail to be strongly impressed with its
personality, if such a word can be applied to a bird.</p>

<p>Dendrocolaptine birds are, as a rule, builders of big nests and very
noisy; <i>H. gutturalis</i> is, I believe, the loudest screamer and greatest
builder of the family. Male and female live together in the same
locality all the year; the young, when able to fly, remain with their
parents till the breeding-season, so that the birds are found occasionally
in pairs, but more frequently in families of five or six individuals.
When feeding they scatter about, each bird attaching itself to a large
bush, scraping and prodding for insects about the roots; and at
intervals one of the old birds, ascending a bush, summons the others
with loud shrill cries, on which they all hurry to the place of meeting,
and from the summits of the bushes burst forth in a piercing chorus,
which sounds at a distance like screams of hysterical laughter. At one
place, where I spent some months, there were some bushes over a mile
and a quarter from the house I lived in, where these birds used to hold
frequent meetings, and in that still atmosphere I could distinctly hear
their extravagant cries at this distance. After each performance they
pursue each other, passing from bush to bush with a wild jerky flight,
and uttering harsh angry notes.</p>

<p>They select a low, strong, wide-spreading bush to build in; the nest,
which is made of stout sticks, is perfectly spherical and four to five feet
deep, the chamber inside being very large. The opening is at the side<a class="pagenum" name="Page_198" id="Page_198">-&nbsp;198&nbsp;-</a>
near the top, and is approached by a narrow arched gallery, neatly
made of slender sticks resting along a horizontal branch, and about
fourteen inches long. This peculiar entrance, no doubt, prevents the
intrusion of snakes and small mammals. So strongly made is the nest
that I have stood on the dome of one and stamped on it with my foot
without injuring it in the least, and to demolish one I had to force my
gun-barrel into it, then prize it up by portions. I examined about a
dozen of these enormous structures, but they were all met with before
or after the laying season, so that I did not see the eggs.</p>

<p>Eyton, when he described this species from Bridges&rsquo;s specimens, gave
its habitat as Bolivia. It may inhabit the southern part of that
Republic, but it is more probable that Bridges&rsquo;s examples were obtained
in Northern Argentina, which he likewise visited. Bridges&rsquo;s Wood-hewer
is the only member of its genus, and is one of the largest of
the whole family <i>Dendrocolaptid&aelig;</i>, measuring some 13 or 14 inches
in length, inclusive of the great curved beak. Although found throughout
the northern portion of the Argentine Republic, its habits are as
yet imperfectly known, but the following extracts show that they must
be very interesting, and that the bird is remarkably versatile. Mr.
Barrows writes:&mdash;&ldquo;These birds are somewhat gregarious, being oftenest
seen in small parties of six to ten. They sometimes cling against the
bark of a tree in the manner of Woodpeckers, but also spend much of
their time on the ground. I think they use their curved bill much
oftener for probing in the ground than for searching the bark of trees,
as many of those shot had the base of the bill and the frontal feathers
plastered with mud. In the stomach of the first one killed I found the
silken sac, three fourths of an inch in diameter, or the eggs of a large
spider, which makes holes ten or twelve inches deep in the hard soil
everywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>White obtained examples of this species at Catamarca, and also
notices its strangely contrasted habits. He writes:&mdash;&ldquo;The cry of this
bird is much the same as that of a Woodpecker, and it clings to the
algarroba trees in a similar way; but in the afternoon it is seen scattered
about on the sandy ground in the pursuit of insects.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is the only member of the genus <i>Picolaptes</i> as yet met with
within the limits of the Argentine Republic. Azara found it abundant
in Paraguay, and on this account named it the Common Climber,
&ldquo;<i>Trepador comun</i>.&rdquo; In Buenos Ayres it is a summer visitant,
appearing at the end of September. It is a solitary bird, never seen
away from the woods, and invariably utters a loud melancholy cry
when passing from one tree to another. It always alights on the
trunk close to the ground, clinging to the bark in a vertical position,
supported by the tail, and with head thrown far back in order to give
free play to the extremely long beak. Having thus alighted, it progresses
upwards by short hops, exploring the crevices in the wood for
small insects, until it reaches the branches, when it flies off to the next
tree.</p>

<p>Azara&rsquo;s account of this species is prefaced by the following remarks
on the birds of this genus known to him in Paraguay:&mdash;&ldquo;These birds
inhabit only the dense and tangled thickets, and never show themselves
outside of their hiding-places, except for a few moments in the early
morning and in the evening; but at no time do they perch high on the
trees, but keep always within a few feet of the earth. They live in
pairs; feed solely on insects caught in the bushes which they frequent,
or on the ground, on which, however, the bird alights only to pick up
its prey, and then returns to the twig to devour it. They are
stationary, and fly only from one thicket to another. Many of the
species have a similar voice or song, which is singular, powerful, and
heard only in the love-season. The call is a trill of a single note
rapidly reiterated, and loud enough to be heard half a mile away; the
cry being accompanied by vibratory motions of the wings.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Western and Southern Argentina and Patagonia.</p>

<p>The vernacular name <i>Gallito</i>, or &ldquo;Little Cock,&rdquo; by which this
species is familiarly known in Patagonia, cannot fail to strike every one
who sees the bird as very appropriate, for it struts and runs on the
ground with tail erect, looking wonderfully like a small domestic fowl.
In the neighbourhood of Carmen, on the Rio Negro, it is very
abundant, and when I went there its loud deep chirrup, heard from
every side in the thicket, quickly arrested my attention, just as the
perpetual chirping of the Sparrows did when I first landed in England.
In the interior of the country it is not nearly so abundant, so that
man&rsquo;s presence has probably in some way affected it favourably. Its
habits amuse and baffle a person anxious to make its acquaintance; for
it scarcely possesses the faculty of flight, and cannot be driven up, but
it is so easily alarmed, so swift of foot, and so fond of concealment,
that it is most difficult to catch a sight of it. At the same time it is
extremely inquisitive, and no sooner does it spy an intruder in the bush
than the warning note is sounded, whereupon every bird within hearing
hops up into a thick thorn-bush, where it utters every three or four
seconds a loud hollow chirrup, and at intervals a violent scolding cry,
several times repeated. When approached they all scuttle away,
masked by the bushes, with amazing swiftness, to take refuge at a
distance, where the loud protest is again resumed; but when the
pursuer gives up the pursuit in disgust and turns away, they immediately
follow him, so that he is perpetually encircled with the same ring of
angry sound, moving with him, coming no nearer and never allowing
its cause to be seen.</p>

<p>On three or four occasions I have seen one rise from the ground and
fly several yards with a feeble fluttering flight; but when closely pursued
in an open place they seem incapable of rising. They generally fly<a class="pagenum" name="Page_207" id="Page_207">-&nbsp;207&nbsp;-</a>
down from the top of a bush, but always ascend it by hopping from
twig to twig.</p>

<p>The nest is made in the centre of a thorny bush two or three feet
from the ground; and is round and domed, with a small aperture at
the side, and built entirely of fine dry grass. The eggs are four in
number and of a pure white.</p>

<p>The Little Cock is nine inches long, has long stout legs, and short,
curved beak. The colour of the head and neck is deep reddish brown,
lined with white, the feathers of the crown forming a crest. The upper
surface and wings olive-brown; tail dark; throat and breast grey;
middle of the belly white, with a broad ruddy rufous patch on each side
reaching to the belly.</p>

<p>Dr. Burmeister tells us that he met with this Chilian species in the

stones like a Dipper.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_208" id="Page_208">-&nbsp;208&nbsp;-</a>Darwin
has given us some interesting notes on this bird:&mdash;&ldquo;This
species is called by the Chilenos &lsquo;Tapacola,&rsquo; or &lsquo;cover your posteriors.&rsquo;
The name is well applied, as the Tapacola generally
carries its short tail more than erect, that is, inclined backward and
toward the head. It is extremely common in Central Chile. The
Tapacola frequents hedge-rows and the bushes which are scattered at a
considerable elevation over the sterile hills, where scarcely another bird
can exist; hence it plays a conspicuous part in the ornithology of
Chile. The Tapacola is very crafty; when frightened by any person,
it will remain motionless at the bottom of a bush, and will then, after a
little while, try with much address to crawl away on the opposite side.
It is also an active bird, and continually making a noise; these noises
are various and strangely odd; one is like the cooing of doves, another
like the bubbling of water, and many defy all similes. The country-people
say it changes its cry five times in the year, which is according,
I suppose, to some change of season. I was told that the Tapacola
builds its nest at the bottom of a deep burrow.&rdquo; (Darwin, in Zool. Voy.
&lsquo;Beagle,&rsquo; iii. p. 72.)</p>

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
